## Notes & Decisions

*Quick notes about this week's focus*

**Context for Week 1:**
- Q1 primary goal: Launch Image feature by Jan 31 (3.5 weeks away)
- R&D grant decision expected end of January (impacts rest of year planning)
- Two-scenario planning: Grant approved (30 hrs/week R&D) vs rejected (full Medtech focus)
- First revenue must happen in 2026; zero revenue in 2025 not acceptable
- Kill signal: No paying customers by Feature #2 (Q2) → pivot or kill Medtech

**This Week's Focus:**
- **Phase 1.0**: Redis + S3 session storage (2 hours with AI tools)
- **Phase 1.1**: Mobile upload UI with real backend (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 1.2**: Mobile → Desktop sync via Ably (1-2 hours)
- **Phase 1.3**: Dataflow review and documentation (1 hour)
- **Customer prep**: GP email, sign-up form, Ting coordination (2 hours)

**Time Reality:**
- Have 2-3 project days available (16-24 hours after GP work)
- Allocated 16-20 hours for Medtech (realistic for Phase 1 completion)
- Roadmap estimates 6-8 hours Phase 1; likely 4-6 hours with AI

**Blockers to Watch:**
- Awaiting R&D grant decision (no action until received)
- Redis/S3 setup might need environment variables configured

**Key Decisions:**
- Week 1 dedicated to Phase 1 foundation (mobile upload + sync)
- Week 2 will be testing, debugging, and preparing for Phase 2
- Customer outreach focused on preparing testers (launch email end of week)
