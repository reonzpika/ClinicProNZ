## Notes & Decisions

*Quick notes about this week's focus*

**Context for Week 1:**
- Q1 primary goal: Launch Image feature by Jan 31 (3.5 weeks away)
- R&D grant decision expected end of January (impacts rest of year planning)
- Two-scenario planning: Grant approved (30 hrs/week R&D) vs rejected (full Medtech focus)
- First revenue must happen in 2026; zero revenue in 2025 not acceptable
- Kill signal: No paying customers by Feature #2 (Q2) → pivot or kill Medtech

**This Week's Focus:**
- Complete Medtech Phase 1: mobile UI + sync + dataflow review
- Prepare GP tester list (5-10 GPs for February)
- Keep using PM AI SaaS daily (dogfooding)

**Blockers to Watch:**
- Awaiting R&D grant decision (no action until received)
- Medtech technical complexity (budget 2x time estimates)

**Key Decisions:**
- Week 1 dedicated to Image feature development (25-30 hrs)
- Customer outreach focused on preparing testers, not yet launching
