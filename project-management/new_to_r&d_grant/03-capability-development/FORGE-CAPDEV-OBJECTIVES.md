# Capability Development Objectives - Forge Portal Format

**Total CapDev:** $36,000 (5.02% of total eligible costs)
**Categories:** 3 objectives (meets "minimum 2" requirement)

---

## Objective CD-1: Regulatory & Compliance Capability for NZ Health AI

**Start Date:** 27 February 2026 (Month 2)  
**End Date:** 26 July 2027 (Month 18)  
**Budget:** $18,000

### Deliverable:
Expert-level regulatory and compliance capability for NZ health AI development, enabling safe pilot deployment and establishing reusable frameworks for Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ. Deliverables include: regulatory gap analysis with remediation roadmap, complete DPIA validating cross-border data handling controls, clinical safety validation reports across MVP and pilot phases, 6-8 ongoing compliance advisory sessions, and governance frameworks with templates.

### Capability Building - How This Transfers Knowledge:
**Founder and Ting gain expert-level capability in:**
- Privacy Act 2020, HIPC, and IPP 12 compliance for health AI (currently have operational knowledge; need expert-level capability for R&D-stage experimental scenarios and multi-PMS integration complexities)
- Medical device software risk assessment frameworks and clinical safety validation methodologies for assist-only AI systems
- Navigating increasingly complex compliance scenarios across MVP development, sandbox testing, pilot deployment, and scale-up phases through hands-on guidance from regulatory experts
- Building reusable governance frameworks, compliance checklists, DPA templates, and incident response procedures applicable to all future health AI projects

**Knowledge Transfer Method:** Third-party experts (privacy/DPIA specialists, clinical safety consultants, regulatory advisers) provide training through gap analysis, DPIA development, safety advisory sessions, and ongoing compliance guidance. Each engagement builds practical skills in handling real compliance challenges. Frameworks and templates created become reusable organizational knowledge.

**Enduring Capability:** After 24 months, team has expert-level compliance capability to manage future health AI R&D independently, avoiding costly compliance failures and enabling patient-facing AI development (Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ) with proper regulatory foundation.

## Objective CD-2: R&D Information Management for Systematic Research

**Start Date:** 27 February 2026 (Month 2)  
**End Date:** 26 September 2026 (Month 8)  
**Budget:** $10,000

### Deliverable:
Systematic R&D documentation and experiment tracking capability enabling reproducible research and efficient knowledge transfer to future projects. Deliverables include: fully configured experiment tracking system integrated with model registry and dataset lineage, standardised evaluation frameworks for measuring AI performance, experiment design templates for systematic investigation, research documentation workflows, and LLM methods advisory reports capturing best practices for clinical AI research documentation.

### Capability Building - How This Transfers Knowledge:
**Founder and Ting gain practical capability in:**
- Building and maintaining experiment tracking systems, model registries, and dataset lineage workflows (currently lack systematic R&D documentation infrastructure)
- Designing experiments with standardised evaluation frameworks that enable consistent comparison across different AI architectural approaches
- Creating evaluation frameworks (how to measure AI performance: accuracy, cost, safety, latency) and experiment design templates (how to structure systematic investigations)
- Documenting AI experiments systematically with proper metadata, versioning protocols, and results archival
- Industry-standard MLOps practices for managing complex AI research programmes and ensuring reproducibility

**Knowledge Transfer Method:** Technical consultants specialising in ML research infrastructure and LLM methods provide hands-on training through system setup, evaluation framework design, and 5-8 advisory sessions. Training includes configuring tracking systems, establishing metadata standards, creating experiment design templates, and building documentation workflows integrated with research infrastructure.

**Enduring Capability:** After 8 months, team has capability to manage systematic R&D documentation across staged investigations (architecture selection, real-world testing, clinical validation). Experiment tracking infrastructure, evaluation frameworks, and documentation workflows are reusable for Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ R&D and beyond. Knowledge properly captured enables efficient learning transfer between projects rather than starting from scratch each time.

## Objective CD-3: R&D Project Management Capability for First-Time R&D Performer

**Start Date:** 27 February 2026 (Month 2)  
**End Date:** 26 June 2027 (Month 16)  
**Budget:** $8,000

### Deliverable:
Structured R&D project management capability transforming team from solo founder to organised R&D operation. Deliverables include: comprehensive R&D project management training for operations lead (Ting), configured agile R&D system with Kanban boards and 24-month roadmap, budget tracking spreadsheets, risk register templates, vendor management workflows, 6-8 coaching session reports with decision-making support, and documented process improvements demonstrating Ting's capability development from novice to independent R&D manager.

### Capability Building - How This Transfers Knowledge:
**Ting (Operations Lead) gains capability to independently manage R&D programmes:**
- Planning and managing R&D projects under uncertainty (vs traditional business projects with predictable outcomes)
- Budget tracking, resource allocation, and risk management specific to R&D programmes
- Managing third-party service providers and consultants (including CapDev procurement for regulatory, compliance, and technical services)
- Breaking down R&D objectives into manageable tasks, creating realistic timelines with contingency planning, and adapting plans as research findings emerge
- Project documentation workflows for milestones, quarterly claims, and programme reporting (complements CD-2's experiment tracking systems)

**Founder gains:**
- Structured approach to R&D management rather than ad-hoc execution
- Decision-making frameworks for R&D trade-offs and resource allocation

**Knowledge Transfer Method:** R&D project management consultant provides intensive training (Months 2-4) establishing foundational capability and systems, followed by ongoing coaching (Months 5-16) through 6-8 sessions scheduled around critical milestones. Coach provides decision-making support, problem-solving guidance, and skill refinement as Ting manages real R&D challenges. This is meta-capability development: training Ting to manage the R&D programme including procurement of other CapDev services.

**Enduring Capability:** After 16 months, Ting has demonstrated capability to run R&D programmes independently. Systems (Kanban, roadmaps, budget tracking, risk registers) and processes become organisational standards reusable for Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ R&D and future projects. Transforms business from solo founder to scalable R&D organisation.
