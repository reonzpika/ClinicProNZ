# Capability Development Evidence Pack
## Updated Following Paula's Feedback (Nov 2025)

---

## Purpose and Scope

Build enduring capability in **two key areas** for NZ clinical AI development:

1. **Intellectual Property (IP)** - Patent protection, FTO analysis, IP portfolio management, legal frameworks
2. **Regulatory & Compliance** - Privacy Act, HIPC, IPP 12, clinical safety, PHO/Medtech compliance, AI ethics

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: CapDev < 5% of Grant
**Current Status:** $15,000 = 5.39% ✓ (exceeds 5% minimum by $1,085)
**Mitigation:** Already exceeded minimum; if costs come in lower, can add adviser sessions or expand patent scope

### Risk: Patent Attorney Costs Higher Than Expected
**Current Budget:** $6,500 for IP attorney work (FTO + provisional)
**Mitigation:**
- Obtain fixed-price quotes before engagement
- Scope provisional patent to core claims only (can expand in full filing)
- FTO can be scaled down to key competitor patents if needed (~$1,500 minimum)
- Have $1,085 buffer above minimum 5% requirement

### Risk: Regulatory Adviser Not Available Throughout Project
**Mitigation:**
- Engage adviser upfront with 24-month retainer agreement
- Schedule all 6 sessions in advance (Months 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18)
- Build relationship during gap analysis phase
- Have backup advisers identified if primary unavailable

### Risk: Internal CapDev Work Confused with R&D Labour
**Mitigation:**
- Clear separation in timesheets: Never claim internal time as CapDev
- Only third-party invoices submitted as CapDev evidence
- All internal implementation work (DPIA, IPP 12 controls, dashboards) claimed as R&D labour
- Maintain separate folders: `/capdev-evidence/` vs `/r&d-deliverables/`

### Risk: Free Courses Questioned by Reviewers
**Mitigation:**
- OPC and Te Whatu Ora are NZ government providers (highly credible)
- Collaborative Aotearoa modules developed specifically for NZ primary care
- Free courses supplement (not replace) paid professional services ($14.5k)
- Focus of CapDev is professional services, not courses

### Risk: IPONZ Provisional Patent Not Filed in Time
**Mitigation:**
- Engage patent attorney Month 2 (allows 8 weeks for drafting/filing)
- Priority date critical for international protection (12-month PCT window)
- Have provisional draft ready before Month 4 milestone
- Can expedite if needed (extra cost covered by buffer)
