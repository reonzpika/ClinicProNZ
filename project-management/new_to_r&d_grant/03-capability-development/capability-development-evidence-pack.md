### CDP-5 ALIGNMENT - Perfect Fit! ✅

From the official CDP-5 document:

✅ **"Increasing R&D-related human capital expertise within the business organisation via training, coaching, or advisory"**
- This is training Ting to become an effective R&D Operations Lead

✅ **Key activities include:**
- "Budget management to keep the project within budget" ← Ting learns this
- "Resource management to ensure you allocate resources efficiently" ← Ting learns this
- "Communications management to identify key stakeholders" ← Ting learns this
- "Roadmaps to visualize tasks throughout project lifecycle" ← Ting creates these
- "Periodic reviews to monitor progress" ← Ting runs these
- "Documentation of knowledge" ← Ting manages this
- "Risk management to identify risks and put mitigation plans in place" ← Ting learns this

✅ **"Your project requirements, including resource requirements, capacity and budgets, may evolve as the project progresses, and your business must be agile and flexible to adapt to those changes"**
- This is exactly what the ongoing coaching addresses

---

### WHY THIS IS SMART:

**Builds long-term capability:**
- Ting isn't just doing admin work - she's learning **how to manage R&D**
- After 24 months, she'll have skills to manage future R&D projects
- Demonstrates "growth intention" (Paula's feedback about having Ting full-time)

**Ting manages the CapDev procurement:**
- Part of her training is learning how to:
  - Identify when you need third-party expertise
  - Scope the work required
  - Find and evaluate providers
  - Manage contracts and deliverables
  - Ensure value for money

**This is meta-capability development:**
- You're using CapDev budget to train Ting on how to manage CapDev activities!
- She'll be responsible for procuring the other CDP services (regulatory, IP, R&D info systems)

---

### HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE:

**Month 2-3:** Consultant trains Ting on R&D project management fundamentals

**Month 3:** Ting creates procurement plan for other CDP activities:
- "We need regulatory gap analysis by Month 3" → Ting finds provider, gets quotes, manages contract
- "We need experiment tracking system by Month 4" → Ting scopes requirements, finds technical consultant
- "We need DPIA by Month 5" → Ting identifies privacy specialists, manages engagement

**Months 4-15:** Ting runs the R&D project with monthly coaching support:
- Creates weekly/monthly timelines
- Tracks budget vs actuals
- Manages contractor developer workload
- Coordinates pilot activities
- Documents learnings
- Escalates risks to founder

**Consultant is Ting's coach/mentor throughout**

---

### DELIVERABLES FOR CDP-5:

**From consultant to Ting:**
- R&D project management training materials (tailored to your project)
- Project management tools and templates set up
- 6 coaching session reports
- Knowledge transfer documentation

**From Ting (demonstrating capability development):**
- 24-month project roadmap with milestones
- Budget tracking spreadsheet (maintained monthly)
- Risk register (updated quarterly)
- Vendor management records for all CDP procurement
- Meeting notes and decision logs
- Monthly progress reports

---

**Total CDP-5 (Project Management):** $5,000

**Value:** Builds Ting's R&D operations management capability. First-time R&D performer needs external expertise to avoid common pitfalls. The training enables Ting to manage the entire R&D project including procurement of other CapDev services. Systems and processes directly reusable for Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ R&D.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: CapDev < 5% of Total Costs
**Current Status:** $36,000 = 5.02% ✓ (exceeds 5% minimum by $154)
**Mitigation:** Already exceeded minimum; minimal buffer but compliant

### Risk: Consultant Availability or Costs Higher Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Obtain fixed-price quotes before engagement for major items (IP, DPIA, safety advisory)
- For ongoing sessions, establish retainer agreements upfront
- Have backup consultants identified for each category
- Front-load spending in Q1-Q2 to lock in providers early

### Risk: Internal CapDev Work Confused with R&D Labour
**Mitigation:**
- Clear separation in timesheets: Never claim internal time as CapDev
- Only third-party invoices submitted as CapDev evidence
- All internal implementation work claimed as R&D labour
- Maintain separate folders: `/capdev-evidence/` vs `/r&d-deliverables/`

### Risk: LLM Training Advisory Not Delivering Value
**Mitigation:**
- Select consultant with proven track record in clinical LLM or NZ healthcare AI
- Structure as 4-6 sessions with clear deliverables per session
- Can adjust scope based on early sessions (e.g., stop at 4 if sufficient)
- Knowledge transfer documented so capability remains after consultant engagement ends

### Risk: Experiment Tracking System Not Used
**Mitigation:**
- Involve founder + Ting in system design (Month 2-4)
- Ensure integration with existing workflows
- Training sessions emphasize practical usage
- System designed for quarterly claims (built-in motivation to maintain)
