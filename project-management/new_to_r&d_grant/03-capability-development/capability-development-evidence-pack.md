## Internal R&D Work (NOT CapDev - Claimed as R&D Labour)

The following activities are part of **R&D work** (not CapDev) and will be claimed as R&D labour costs:

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: CapDev < 5% of Grant
**Current Status:** $16,600 confirmed = 6.1% ✓ (exceeds 5% minimum)
**Mitigation:** Already exceeded minimum; additional workshops will increase further

### Risk: Conference Attendance Not Directly Linked to CD
**Mitigation:** 
- Document specific IP/regulatory workshops attended at each conference
- Obtain detailed session lists showing topics
- Link learnings back to R&D project in quarterly reports
- Focus on conferences with dedicated health tech IP/privacy tracks

### Risk: Expert Review Costs Higher Than Budgeted
**Mitigation:**
- Obtain quotes upfront before engagement
- Scope reviews to specific deliverables (DPIA, IP strategy)
- Have buffer in conference budget (~$3k additional)
- Can add supplementary paid courses if needed to maintain 5% threshold

### Risk: Internal CapDev Work Confused with R&D Labour
**Mitigation:**
- Clear separation in timesheets: "CapDev - Privacy Course" vs "R&D - Implement IPP 12 Controls"
- Only claim third-party costs as CapDev
- All internal implementation work claimed as R&D labour under objectives
- Maintain separate evidence folders for CapDev vs R&D
