# Capability Development Evidence Pack
## Version 3.0 - Revised Structure (Dec 2025)

---

## Purpose and Scope

Build enduring capability in **three key areas** for NZ clinical AI development:

1. **Regulatory & Compliance** - Privacy Act, HIPC, IPP 12, clinical safety, PHO/Medtech compliance, AI ethics, DPIA
2. **R&D Information Management** - Experiment tracking, model registry, LLM experiment documentation workflows, research documentation
3. **Project Management** - R&D operations, agile systems, risk management, stage-gate processes

**Strategy:** Focus on high-value third-party professional services that provide practical, actionable outputs directly supporting R&D project success and building capability for future R&D programmes (Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ).

**Key Requirement:** CapDev must be ≥5% of total eligible R&D costs = **$35,846 minimum** (based on $716,926 total eligible costs)

**Rationale for Structure:** As a first-time R&D performer, we prioritise building capabilities that directly de-risk the R&D programme (compliance, systematic documentation, project management). IP protection will be addressed post-grant once innovations are validated and commercial pathway is clear.

---

---

### HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE:

**Month 2-4:** Consultant trains Ting on R&D project management fundamentals and sets up operational systems.

**Month 3-4:** Ting creates procurement plan for other CDP activities:
- "We need regulatory gap analysis by Month 3" → Ting finds provider, gets quotes, manages contract
- "We need experiment tracking system by Month 4" → Ting scopes requirements, finds technical consultant
- "We need DPIA by Month 5" → Ting identifies privacy specialists, manages engagement

**Months 5-16:** Ting runs the R&D project with periodic coaching support:
- Creates and maintains project roadmap and timelines
- Tracks budget vs actuals, forecasts spend
- Manages contractor developer workload allocation
- Coordinates pilot activities with GP practices
- Documents learnings and experiment results
- Escalates risks to founder when needed
- Prepares quarterly claims

**Consultant is Ting's coach/mentor throughout, providing decision support and capability building.**

---

### DELIVERABLES DEMONSTRATING CAPABILITY DEVELOPMENT:

**From consultant:**
- R&D project management training materials
- Configured PM system and templates
- Coaching session reports (6-8 sessions)
- Knowledge transfer documentation

**From Ting (demonstrating capability growth):**
- 24-month project roadmap (maintained and updated)
- Budget tracking spreadsheet (monthly updates)
- Risk register (quarterly updates)
- Vendor management records for all CDP procurement
- Meeting notes and decision logs
- Monthly/quarterly progress reports
- Experiment documentation for quarterly claims

---

**Total CDP-5 (Project Management):** $8,000

**Rationale for allocation:** As a first-time R&D performer, structured project management capability is essential for avoiding common pitfalls (scope creep, timeline blow-outs, budget overruns, documentation gaps). Investment in Ting's capability pays dividends throughout 24-month project and builds enduring skills for Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ R&D and future programmes.

**Current Status:** $36,000 = 5.02% ✓ (exceeds 5% minimum by $154)
**Mitigation:** Already exceeded minimum; minimal buffer but compliant

### Risk: Consultant Availability or Costs Higher Than Expected
**Mitigation:**
- Obtain fixed-price quotes before engagement for major items (IP, DPIA, safety advisory)
- For ongoing sessions, establish retainer agreements upfront
- Have backup consultants identified for each category
- Front-load spending in Q1-Q2 to lock in providers early

### Risk: Internal CapDev Work Confused with R&D Labour
**Mitigation:**
- Clear separation in timesheets: Never claim internal time as CapDev
- Only third-party invoices submitted as CapDev evidence
- All internal implementation work claimed as R&D labour
- Maintain separate folders: `/capdev-evidence/` vs `/r&d-deliverables/`

### Risk: LLM Methods Advisory Not Delivering Value
**Mitigation:**
- Select consultant with proven track record in ML research infrastructure and documentation methodologies
- Structure as 5-8 sessions with clear deliverables per session (evaluation frameworks, experiment design templates)
- Can adjust scope based on early sessions (e.g., stop at 5 if documentation workflows sufficient)
- Focus on outputs that integrate with experiment tracking system (not standalone training)
- Knowledge transfer documented so capability remains after consultant engagement ends

### Risk: Experiment Tracking System Not Used
**Mitigation:**
- Involve founder + Ting in system design (Month 2-4)
- Ensure integration with existing workflows
- Training sessions emphasize practical usage
- System designed for quarterly claims (built-in motivation to maintain)
