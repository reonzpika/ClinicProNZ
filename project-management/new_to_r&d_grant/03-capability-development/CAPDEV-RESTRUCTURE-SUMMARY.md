# CapDev Restructure Summary

**Date:** 4 December 2025  
**Version:** 3.0  
**Change Type:** Strategic restructure based on first-time R&D performer needs

---

## What Changed

### Structure: 4 Categories → 3 Categories

**REMOVED:**
- ❌ CDP-2: Intellectual Property ($7,500)
  - IP Audit & FTO Analysis ($2,000)
  - Provisional Patent Filing ($4,500)
  - NDAs, Contracts & Trademark ($1,000)

**INCREASED:**
- ✅ CDP-3: Regulatory & Compliance: $15,000 → **$18,000** (+$3,000)
- ✅ CDP-6: R&D Information Management: $8,500 → **$10,000** (+$1,500)
- ✅ CDP-5: Project Management: $5,000 → **$8,000** (+$3,000)

**Total Maintained:** $36,000 (5.02% of total eligible costs) ✓

---

## Why These Changes

### Removed IP ($7,500)

**Rationale:**
- You don't know what innovations work yet (investigating multiple architectural paradigms)
- Provisional patents filed at Month 6 = decision at Month 18, but results won't be validated until Month 20+
- Filing patents on unproven technology = wasted money
- Better strategy: Document everything systematically, file patents post-grant (Year 3) once you know what actually works

**IP Protection Strategy:**
- Use trade secrets and NDAs (free templates) during R&D
- Document innovations systematically through experiment tracking
- Assess patent strategy at Month 18-24 based on validated results
- File patents post-grant or with Year 3 funding

---

### Increased Regulatory & Compliance ($15k → $18k)

**Added $3,000 for:**
- Better regulatory adviser engagement ($5,000 instead of $3,000)
  - More substantial sessions (was $500/session = 1.5-2 hours, now $625-750/session = 2-3 hours)
  - Flexibility for 6-8 sessions instead of rigid 6 sessions
- Expanded compliance documentation ($2,000 instead of $1,000)
  - More comprehensive governance frameworks
  - Better DPA templates and negotiation support

**Why this matters:**
- **Critical for avoiding pilot shutdown** due to compliance failures
- Privacy Act 2020, HIPC, IPP 12 compliance is complex
- Clinical safety validation essential for health AI
- DPIA required before pilot with real patient data
- You WILL hit compliance roadblocks, better to have expert support

---

### Increased R&D Info Management ($8.5k → $10k)

**Added $1,500 for:**
- Better experiment tracking setup ($4,000 instead of $3,500)
  - More robust system configuration
  - Better integration with development workflow
- More LLM methods advisory ($6,000 instead of $5,000)
  - 5-8 sessions instead of 4-6 sessions
  - Focus on experiment design, evaluation frameworks, and documentation methodologies
  - Ensures outputs integrate with tracking system
  - Extended timeline (Months 2-8 instead of 2-6)

**Why this matters:**
- **Essential for systematic research** (investigating multiple architectural paradigms)
- Without proper documentation methodology, you won't know what worked or why
- Hundreds of experiments = need standardised documentation and comparison frameworks
- LLM experiment documentation for architectural comparison is complex
- Proper knowledge capture enables transfer to Years 3-5 HealthHub NZ

---

### Increased Project Management ($5k → $8k)

**Added $3,000 for:**
- Better PM training & setup ($3,500 instead of $2,500)
  - More intensive training for first-time R&D performer
  - Better system setup and templates
- More coaching sessions ($4,500 instead of $2,500)
  - 6-8 sessions instead of fixed 6 sessions
  - Extended timeline (Months 5-16 instead of 5-15)
  - Flexibility around critical milestones

**Why this matters:**
- **You're a first-time R&D performer** - Ting needs solid coaching
- R&D project management is different from business project management
- Without structure: scope creep, timeline blow-outs, budget overruns, documentation gaps
- Investment pays for itself by avoiding wasted time and experiments
- Builds enduring capability for Years 3-5 and beyond

---

## Writing Style Changes

### Before: Rigid and Prescriptive

```
**4. Ongoing Regulatory Adviser (6 sessions): $3,000**
- Timing: Months 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 (~$500 per session)
- Session 1 (Month 4): MVP feature review
- Session 2 (Month 6): Medtech sandbox testing
- Session 3 (Month 9): Care gap monitoring feature
```

**Problem:** You don't know exact timing or what you'll need. This looks like false precision.

### After: Flexible and Realistic

```
**Ongoing Regulatory Adviser ($5,000, Months 4-18):**
Activities may include: Expert guidance through development, sandbox, pilot, and scale-up phases. 
Approximately 6-8 advisory sessions scheduled flexibly based on R&D milestones and compliance needs.
```

**Better because:**
- "May include" = flexibility for emerging needs
- "Approximately 6-8 sessions" = not locked into exact number
- "Flexibly scheduled" = can adapt to R&D progress
- Shows you understand first-time R&D has uncertainty

---

## Key Benefits

### ✅ More Realistic for First-Time R&D
- Flexible descriptions ("may include") reflect genuine uncertainty
- Focused on de-risking critical areas (compliance, documentation, management)
- Removed speculative activities (patenting unproven innovations)

### ✅ Better Value for Money
- Regulatory adviser: $625-750/session (2-3 hours) instead of $500/session (1.5 hours)
- PM coaching: $560-750/session instead of $417/session
- More substantial expert engagement = better outcomes

### ✅ Stronger Callaghan Assessment
- Shows self-awareness as first-time R&D performer
- Budget allocated to de-risking R&D (compliance, structure, documentation)
- Not over-planning unknowns
- IP strategy is actually smarter (file post-validation, not pre-validation)

### ✅ Still Meets Requirements
- Total: $36,000 (5.02% of total eligible costs) ✓
- Categories: 3 (exceeds "≥2 categories" requirement) ✓
- Third-party only: Yes ✓
- Builds enduring capability: Yes ✓

## What Assessor Will See

**Before (Red Flags):**
- ❌ "6 sessions at exactly Month 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18" (how do you know?)
- ❌ Provisional patent at Month 6 (you don't know what to patent yet)
- ❌ $500/session for expert advice (too cheap, only 1.5 hours)
- ❌ Rigid planning that suggests lack of flexibility

**After (Green Flags):**
- ✅ "Approximately 6-8 sessions, flexibly scheduled" (realistic)
- ✅ No premature IP spending (smart strategy)
- ✅ Market-rate expert engagement ($625-750/session)
- ✅ Focused on de-risking critical areas
- ✅ Self-aware first-time R&D performer
- ✅ "May include" language shows appropriate flexibility

---

## Action Required

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Portal answer updated and ready
2. ✅ All documents consistent
3. ✅ Total maintained at $36,000 (5.02%)
4. ⏭️ **Review and approve this structure**
5. ⏭️ Submit application with revised CapDev

### No Further Changes Needed:
- Cost template already correct ($36k total)
- Cashflow already correct (CapDev timing broad enough)
- Budget summary tables updated
- All cross-references consistent

---

**Status:** Ready for final review and submission

**Confidence Level:** High - This structure is more defensible, realistic, and aligned with first-time R&D performer needs.
