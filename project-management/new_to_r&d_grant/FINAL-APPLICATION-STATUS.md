## Callaghan Innovation 5-Test Assessment

### **Test 1: Uncertainty**
✅ **PASS (9/10)**

**Evidence:**
- Five cascading research uncertainties clearly defined
- Architectural paradigm selection across clinical risk spectrum
- Domain adaptation feasibility under sovereignty constraints
- Multi-system generalisation patterns
- Safety-architecture interaction effects
- Equity algorithm generalisability

**Why strong:** All uncertainties are genuine (cannot be deduced without systematic investigation)

---

### **Test 2: Knowledge Not Available**
✅ **PASS (9/10)**

**Evidence:**
- Documentation/automation tools don't resolve decision-support uncertainties
- Generic AI systems (GPT-4, Claude) show capability but not sovereign deployment pathways
- Academic research validates isolated components, not integrated systems
- Commercial implementations keep methods proprietary (trade secrets)
- Lab-to-clinic translation patterns unpublished

**Why strong:** Comprehensive analysis of existing knowledge gaps

---

### **Test 3: Expert Cannot Solve**
✅ **PASS (9/10)**

**Evidence:**
- Multi-component architecture performance cannot be predicted from component specifications
- Multi-system generalisation creates emergent failure modes
- Real-world clinical data causes unpredictable architecture-specific failures
- Safety mechanisms interact with architectural paradigms creating emergent failure modes
- AI performance metrics don't predict clinical outcome improvements

**Why strong:** Focus on emergent behavior, unpredictable interactions, systematic investigation required

---

### **Test 4: Systematic Approach**
✅ **PASS (9/10)**

**Evidence:**
- Clear research methodology across all 4 objectives
- Two clinical testbeds (Inbox Helper, Care Gap Finder)
- Controlled experiments on synthetic data → real clinical data
- Systematic measurement across diverse practices (10-20)
- Quantified outcomes (≥95% CVDRA accuracy, ≥85% care gap detection, ≤0.5% prohibited claims)

**Why strong:** Rigorous experimental design with measurable outcomes

---

### **Test 5: New Knowledge**
✅ **PASS (9/10)**

**Evidence:**
Three bodies of novel knowledge:
1. Architectural paradigm performance under combined clinical constraints
2. Lab-to-clinic performance translation and real-world failure modes
3. Safety mechanisms across paradigms and equity-preserving algorithms

**Why strong:**
- Knowledge outputs clearly defined
- Transferable to broader NZ health AI sector
- Fills critical gaps (emerging paradigm validation, equity algorithms, sovereign deployment patterns)

## Transformation Summary

### **From Product Development to Genuine R&D**

**Version 3.0 (28 Nov) - 6-7/10:**
- ❌ GPT-4 benchmarking throughout
- ❌ Rigid architectural assumptions
- ❌ Feature lists as deliverables
- ❌ Product-focused language
- ❌ Inconsistent between sections
- ❌ 2,000-2,500 words per objective (too long, redundant)

**Version 4.3 (2 Dec) - 9/10:**
- ✅ No GPT-4 benchmarking anywhere
- ✅ Architectural flexibility (open exploration)
- ✅ Knowledge outputs as primary deliverables
- ✅ Research-focused language throughout
- ✅ Fully consistent across all sections
- ✅ 750-1,200 words per objective (concise, focused, balanced)

**Improvement:** +2-3 points across all components

---

## Key Improvements Made

### **1. Removed All GPT-4 Benchmarking**
- **Before:** "Benchmark NZ-LLM vs GPT-4," "Match GPT-4 at lower cost"
- **After:** "Systematically investigate which architectural paradigms achieve clinical safety, accuracy, cost-effectiveness"
- **Impact:** From comparison study (6/10) → Genuine R&D (9/10)

### **2. Added Architectural Flexibility**
- **Before:** "3-4 predetermined approaches"
- **After:** "Open exploration of paradigm spectrum. Research will follow where empirical evidence leads."
- **Impact:** Shows genuine uncertainty and openness to discovery

### **3. Fixed Weak R&D Questions**
- Objective 2, Q3: UI Trust (4/10) → Edge Case Detection (9/10)
- Objective 3, Q3: Alert Overload (4/10) → Multi-Condition Reasoning Complexity (9/10)
- R&D Activities Q1: "Alert fatigue" → "Clinician override patterns"

### **4. Removed Massive Redundancy**
- Objective 2: 800-word section removed
- Objective 3: 300-word section removed
- Objective 4: 940-word section removed
- **Total:** ~2,040 words of redundancy removed

### **5. Changed Focus from NZ Linguistic to NZ Healthcare System Context**
- **Before:** "Māori code-switching, bilingual terminology, linguistic characteristics"
- **After:** "NZ healthcare system characteristics (bpac/MoH guidelines, regional lab formats, ACC/PHO documentation patterns)"
- **Why:** Linguistic challenges not significant technical R&D; healthcare context is

### **6. Achieved Balance Across All Objectives**
- **Before:** 1,200 / 3,240 / 2,060 / 2,500 words (huge variation)
- **After:** 1,200 / 910 / 1,055 / 750 words (balanced range)
