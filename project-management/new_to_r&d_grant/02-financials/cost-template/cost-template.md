## Internal Labour Tab

**Founder (Shareholder-employee):** $96/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Founder R&D Hours (24 months):**
- 30 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 2 years ÷ 12 months/year = 130 hrs/month
- 130 hrs/month × 24 months = 3,120 hours
- **Total Founder R&D Labour: 3,120 hours = $299,520**

**Ting (Shareholder-employee, R&D Programme Manager):** $70/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Ting R&D Hours (24 months):**
- 40 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 2 years ÷ 12 months/year = 173 hrs/month
- 173 hrs/month × 24 months = 4,152 hours
- **Role:** Research Synthesis & Documentation (25%), Evaluation Framework Support (20%), Programme Management (25%), Grant Administration (15%), Stakeholder Management & Pilot Operations (15%)
- **Key Activities:** Transform technical findings into structured research reports and knowledge base; maintain performance dashboards and edge case databases; manage programme timeline and budget; prepare grant claims and final R&D report; coordinate pilot operations
- **Total Ting R&D Labour: 4,152 hours = $290,640**

**Developer (Contractor, starts Month 4):** $72/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Developer R&D Hours (21 months, Months 4-24):**
- Minimum 10 hrs/week (can scale 10-40 hrs/week based on workload)
- Budgeted at minimum: 10 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 1.75 years ÷ 12 months/year = 43 hrs/month
- 43 hrs/month × 21 months = 903 hours
- **Total Developer R&D Labour (minimum): 903 hours = $65,016**

**TOTAL R&D LABOUR (at minimum developer hours): 8,175 hours = $655,176**

**Note:** Developer hours budgeted conservatively at 10 hrs/week. Actual quarterly claims will reflect real hours worked (10-40 hrs/week range), allowing flexibility to scale up during intensive development phases (O2-O4).

- Cloud GPU Services (AWS g5.xlarge Sydney): $7,200
- Other Cloud Infrastructure: $9,120
- Hardware (RAM, monitor, arms, iPhone): $1,750

### Development Tools & Software ($7,680)
- AI-assisted development tools, code editors, version control, testing frameworks
- $320/month × 24 months
- Essential for efficient R&D development and code quality

### Cloud GPU Services ($7,200)
- AWS g5.xlarge GPU instances (Sydney region)
- For NZ-LLM training, fine-tuning, and inference testing
- $300/month × 24 months
- Required for architecture validation and pilot workloads

### Other Cloud Infrastructure ($9,120)
- NZ data storage (PHI at rest, NZ-held encryption keys)
- AU transient inference infrastructure
- Networking, data transfer
- SIEM security monitoring
- Backup systems
- $380/month × 24 months
- Privacy Act 2020 and IPP 12 compliant infrastructure

### Hardware ($1,750)
**Month 1:**
- RAM Upgrade 128GB: $400
- Monitor: $400
- Dual Monitor Arms: $100
- NVMe SSD 2TB: $150

**Month 4:**
- iPhone SE (testing device): $700

**Total Hardware: $1,750**

**Note:** GPU workstation ($11k) deferred. Using cloud GPU infrastructure provides better grant coverage (40% vs 26.7% depreciation) and operational flexibility.

---

## Hardware & Depreciation Tab

**Hardware included in M&C above: $1,750**

**Strategy:** Defer GPU workstation purchase. Use cloud GPU infrastructure (budgeted in M&C at $300/month) which provides better grant coverage (40% vs 26.7% effective rate for depreciation) and operational flexibility.

**Immediate Expenses:**

**Month 1 Development Setup:**
- RAM Upgrade 128GB: $400
- Monitor: $400
- Dual Monitor Arms: $100
- NVMe SSD 2TB: $150
- **Subtotal Month 1: $1,050**

**Month 4 Testing Device:**
- iPhone SE (testing device): $700
- **Subtotal Month 4: $700**

**TOTAL HARDWARE: $1,750** (included in M&C total above)

**No Depreciation Items:** All hardware purchases under $1,000 threshold, expensed immediately.

---

**Deferred Hardware (Not in Grant Budget):**
- GPU Workstation (~$11k): Can be purchased with co-funding or post-grant if cloud GPU proves insufficient
- Rationale: Cloud GPU provides 40% grant coverage vs 26.7% for workstation depreciation, plus greater flexibility

---

## Totals (24-Month Programme; NZD excl. GST)

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Founder R&D Labour (3,120 hrs): $299,520
- Ting R&D Labour (4,152 hrs): $290,640
- Developer R&D Labour (903 hrs minimum): $65,016
- Capability Development (third-party services): $36,000
- Materials & Consumables (includes hardware): $25,750

**TOTAL ELIGIBLE COST (at minimum developer hours): $716,926**

**Grant at 40%: $286,770**
**Co-funding at 60%: $430,156**

---

### Capability Development Requirement Check

**Required:** ≥5% of total eligible costs = $35,846  
**Actual:** $36,000  
**Percentage:** 5.02% ✓ **MEETS REQUIREMENT**

**Status:** ✓ Compliant with Paula's confirmation (29 Nov 2025)
- Only third-party professional services counted ✓
- No internal labour included in CapDev ✓
- Four capability categories (IP + Regulatory + R&D Info Mgmt + Project Mgmt) ✓
- Practical outputs building capability for this project AND future R&D ✓
- Meets 5% of total costs requirement (not 5% of grant) ✓

---

### Developer Flexibility Note

**Budgeted at Minimum (10 hrs/week):**
- Conservative estimate for grant application
- Ensures achievable commitment baseline
- Lower co-funding requirement

**Actual Claims (10-40 hrs/week):**
- Quarterly claims reflect real hours worked
- Scale up during intensive phases:
  - O2 (Admin automation): 20-30 hrs/week
  - O3 (Clinical intelligence): 30-40 hrs/week
  - O4 (Pilot preparation): 20-30 hrs/week
- Scale down during lighter phases:
  - O1 (Foundation): 10-15 hrs/week
  - Between objectives: 10 hrs/week

**Example Maximum Scenario:**
- If developer works 40 hrs/week (4x minimum):
- Developer: 3,612 hours @ $72/hr = $260,064
- Total developer cost: $260,064 (vs $65,016 minimum)
- Would increase total eligible costs to ~$891k
- Would increase grant to ~$356k (40%)

**Flexibility Benefits:**
- Respond to R&D uncertainty (scale up if challenges arise)
- Accelerate development if progress is faster than expected
- Maintain quality by adding resources during critical phases
- Budget conservatively for approval, scale as needed in practice
