## 24-Month R&D Programme
## NZD excl. GST

---

## Assumptions (for All Tabs)

**Team Structure:**
- **Founder (shareholder-employee):** $96/hour (= $80/hr + 20% overhead), PAYE, timesheets required
- **Founder commitment:** 30 hrs/week throughout 24 months (3,120 hours total)
- **Ting (shareholder-employee, R&D Operations Lead):** $70/hour (= $58.33/hr + 20% overhead), PAYE, timesheets required
- **Ting commitment:** 40 hrs/week throughout 24 months (4,152 hours total)
- **Ting role:** R&D Project Manager + Research/Testing/Documentation + Quality Assurance
- **Developer 1 (contractor):** $72/hour (= $60/hr + 20% overhead), starts Month 4
- **Developer 1 commitment:** Minimum 10 hrs/week (can range 10-40 hrs/week as needed), 21 months (Months 4-24)
- **Developer 1 budgeted hours:** 903 hours (10 hrs/week minimum)
- **Developer 2 (contractor):** $72/hour (= $60/hr + 20% overhead), starts Month 13
- **Developer 2 commitment:** Minimum 10 hrs/week (can range 10-40 hrs/week as needed), 12 months (Months 13-24)
- **Developer 2 budgeted hours:** 520 hours (10 hrs/week minimum)

**Note on Developer Hours:** Budgeted at minimum 10 hrs/week. Actual hours claimed quarterly will vary 10-40 hrs/week based on R&D workload and project needs. Flexibility allows scaling up during intensive development phases.

**Other Costs:**
- **Capability Development:** $15,000 (third-party professional services only)
  - IP professional services: $7,500
  - Regulatory & compliance services: $7,500
- **Materials & consumables (M&C):** $1,000/month × 24 months = $24,000
- **Hardware:** Development essentials + testing devices (immediate expenses only) = $1,800
- **Overseas labour:** None. AU is used only for transient inference; not a labour cost

**Note on Hardware Strategy:** GPU workstation ($11k) deferred. Using cloud GPU infrastructure (budgeted in M&C) provides better grant coverage (40% vs 26.7%) and operational flexibility. Workstation can be purchased with co-funding or post-grant if needed.

| **Total M&C** | **$1,000/month** | **$12,000/year** | **$24,000 over 24 months** |

**Phase-Based Usage:**
- **Year 1 (O1-O2):** Lower GPU usage (~$830/month average), foundation and early development
- **Year 2 (O3-O4):** Higher GPU usage (~$1,140/month average), pilot testing and scale-up

**Flexibility:** GPU and staging costs will scale based on actual R&D needs. Budget reflects conservative average across 24 months.

---

## Hardware & Depreciation Tab

**Strategy:** Defer GPU workstation purchase. Use cloud GPU infrastructure (budgeted in M&C at $300/month) which provides better grant coverage (40% vs 26.7% effective rate for depreciation) and operational flexibility.

**Immediate Expenses (< $1,000 threshold, eligible immediately):**

**Month 1 Development Setup:**
- RAM Upgrade (64GB → 128GB): $400
- Monitor (27" or 32" for development): $300
- Dual Monitor Arms (ergonomic setup): $150
- NVMe SSD 2TB (additional storage): $150
- **Subtotal Month 1: $1,000**

**Month 4 Testing Device:**
- iPhone for mobile app testing: $800 (refurbished or new, depending on model)
- **Subtotal Month 4: $800**

**TOTAL HARDWARE (Immediate Expenses Only): $1,800**

**No Depreciation Items:** All hardware purchases under $1,000 threshold, expensed immediately.

---

**Deferred Hardware (Not in Grant Budget):**
- GPU Workstation (~$11k): Can be purchased with co-funding or post-grant if cloud GPU proves insufficient
- Rationale: Cloud GPU provides 40% grant coverage vs 26.7% for workstation depreciation, plus greater flexibility

---

- No internal labour included in CapDev ✓
- Two capability categories (IP + Regulatory) ✓
- Practical outputs (patents, compliance frameworks, expert reviews) ✓
- Exceeds 5% minimum by $332 ✓

---

### Developer Flexibility Note

**Budgeted at Minimum (10 hrs/week):**
- Conservative estimate for grant application
- Ensures achievable commitment baseline
- Lower co-funding requirement

**Actual Claims (10-40 hrs/week):**
- Quarterly claims reflect real hours worked
- Scale up during intensive phases:
  - O2 (Admin automation): 20-30 hrs/week
  - O3 (Clinical intelligence): 30-40 hrs/week
  - O4 (Pilot preparation): 20-30 hrs/week
- Scale down during lighter phases:
  - O1 (Foundation): 10-15 hrs/week
  - Between objectives: 10 hrs/week

**Example Maximum Scenario:**
- If both developers work 40 hrs/week (4x minimum):
- Developer 1: 3,612 hours @ $72/hr = $260,064
- Developer 2: 2,080 hours @ $72/hr = $149,760
- Total developer cost: $409,824 (vs $102,456 minimum)
- Would increase total eligible costs to ~$1.12M
- Would increase grant to ~$448k (40%)

**Flexibility Benefits:**
- Respond to R&D uncertainty (scale up if challenges arise)
- Accelerate development if progress is faster than expected
- Maintain quality by adding resources during critical phases
- Budget conservatively for approval, scale as needed in practice
