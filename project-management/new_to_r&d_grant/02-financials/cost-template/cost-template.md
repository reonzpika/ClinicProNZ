## Assumptions (for All Tabs)

**Team Structure:**
- **Founder (shareholder-employee):** $96/hour (= $80/hr + 20% overhead), PAYE, timesheets required
- **Founder commitment:** 30 hrs/week throughout 24 months (3,120 hours total)
- **Ting (shareholder-employee, R&D Operations Lead):** $70/hour (= $58.33/hr + 20% overhead), PAYE, timesheets required
- **Ting commitment:** 40 hrs/week throughout 24 months (4,152 hours total)
- **Ting role:** R&D Project Manager + Research/Testing/Documentation + Quality Assurance
- **Developer 1 (contractor):** $72/hour (= $60/hr + 20% overhead), starts Month 4
- **Developer 1 commitment:** Minimum 10 hrs/week (can range 10-40 hrs/week as needed), 21 months (Months 4-24)
- **Developer 1 budgeted hours:** 903 hours (10 hrs/week minimum)
- **Developer 2 (contractor):** $72/hour (= $60/hr + 20% overhead), starts Month 13

- **Developer 2 budgeted hours:** 520 hours (10 hrs/week minimum)

**Note on Developer Hours:** Budgeted at minimum 10 hrs/week. Actual hours claimed quarterly will vary 10-40 hrs/week based on R&D workload and project needs. Flexibility allows scaling up during intensive development phases.

**Other Costs:**
- **Capability Development:** $14,500 (third-party professional services only)
  - IP professional services: $7,500
  - Regulatory & compliance services: $7,000
- **Materials & consumables (M&C):** $200/month × 24 months = $4,800
- **Hardware:** Workstation + testing devices (2-year depreciation + immediate expenses) = $4,184
- **Overseas labour:** None. AU is used only for transient inference; not a labour cost

---

## Objectives to Reference

**Note:** Paula's feedback recommended reducing from 5 objectives to 4 objectives spanning 24 months. Final objective structure to be finalized based on `revised-objectives-24-months.md` working document.

**Provisional Structure (24 Months):**
- **O1:** Foundation & Architecture Validation (Months 1-8)
- **O2:** Admin Automation + Lightweight Architecture (Months 6-14)

**Capability Development (2 Categories):**
- **CD-A:** Intellectual Property (IP Audit, Provisional Patent, NDAs/Contracts)
- **CD-B:** Regulatory & Compliance (Gap Analysis, Ongoing Adviser, Compliance Roadmap)

---

## Internal Labour Tab

**Founder (Shareholder-employee):** $96/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Founder R&D Hours (24 months):**
- 30 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 2 years ÷ 12 months/year = 130 hrs/month
- 130 hrs/month × 24 months = 3,120 hours
- **Total Founder R&D Labour: 3,120 hours = $299,520**

**Ting (Shareholder-employee, R&D Operations Lead):** $70/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Ting R&D Hours (24 months):**
- 40 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 2 years ÷ 12 months/year = 173 hrs/month
- 173 hrs/month × 24 months = 4,152 hours
- Role: R&D Project Manager + Research/Testing/Documentation + Quality Assurance
- **Total Ting R&D Labour: 4,152 hours = $290,640**

**Developer 1 (Contractor, starts Month 4):** $72/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Developer 1 R&D Hours (21 months, Months 4-24):**
- Minimum 10 hrs/week (can scale 10-40 hrs/week based on workload)
- Budgeted at minimum: 10 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year × 1.75 years ÷ 12 months/year = 43 hrs/month
- 43 hrs/month × 21 months = 903 hours
- **Total Developer 1 R&D Labour (minimum): 903 hours = $65,016**

**Developer 2 (Contractor, starts Month 13):** $72/hour | **NZD excl. GST**

**Developer 2 R&D Hours (12 months, Months 13-24):**
- Minimum 10 hrs/week (can scale 10-40 hrs/week based on workload)
- Budgeted at minimum: 10 hrs/week × 52 weeks/year ÷ 12 months/year = 43 hrs/month
- 43 hrs/month × 12 months = 520 hours
- **Total Developer 2 R&D Labour (minimum): 520 hours = $37,440**

**TOTAL R&D LABOUR (at minimum developer hours): 8,695 hours = $692,616**

**Note:** Developer hours budgeted conservatively at 10 hrs/week. Actual quarterly claims will reflect real hours worked (10-40 hrs/week range), allowing flexibility to scale up during intensive development phases (O2-O4).

## Totals (24-Month Programme; NZD excl. GST)

**Cost Breakdown:**
- Founder R&D Labour (3,120 hrs): $299,520
- Ting R&D Labour (4,152 hrs): $290,640
- Developer 1 R&D Labour (903 hrs minimum): $65,016
- Developer 2 R&D Labour (520 hrs minimum): $37,440
- Capability Development (third-party services): $14,500

**TOTAL ELIGIBLE COST (at minimum developer hours): $716,100**

**Grant at 40%: $286,440**
**Co-funding at 60%: $429,660**

---

### Capability Development Requirement Check

**Required:** ≥5% of grant = $14,322  
**Actual:** $14,500  
**Percentage:** 5.06% ✓ **MEETS REQUIREMENT**

**Status:** ✓ Compliant with Paula's feedback:
- Only third-party professional services counted
- No internal labour included in CapDev
- Two capability categories (IP + Regulatory)
- Practical outputs (patents, compliance frameworks, expert reviews)

---

### Developer Flexibility Note

**Budgeted at Minimum (10 hrs/week):**
- Conservative estimate for grant application
- Ensures achievable commitment baseline
- Lower co-funding requirement

**Actual Claims (10-40 hrs/week):**
- Quarterly claims reflect real hours worked
- Scale up during intensive phases:
  - O2 (Admin automation): 20-30 hrs/week
  - O3 (Clinical intelligence): 30-40 hrs/week
  - O4 (Pilot preparation): 20-30 hrs/week
- Scale down during lighter phases:
  - O1 (Foundation): 10-15 hrs/week
  - Between objectives: 10 hrs/week

**Example Maximum Scenario:**
- If both developers work 40 hrs/week (4x minimum):
- Developer 1: 3,612 hours @ $72/hr = $260,064
- Developer 2: 2,080 hours @ $72/hr = $149,760
- Total developer cost: $409,824 (vs $102,456 minimum)
- Would increase total eligible costs to ~$1.12M
- Would increase grant to ~$448k (40%)

**Flexibility Benefits:**
- Respond to R&D uncertainty (scale up if challenges arise)
- Accelerate development if progress is faster than expected
- Maintain quality by adding resources during critical phases
- Budget conservatively for approval, scale as needed in practice
