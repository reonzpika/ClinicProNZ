## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CASHFLOW REQUIRES AU RESERVE FUNDS

**Problem:** With $100k NZD opening cash alone, cashflow goes negative from Month 9 onwards.

**Solution:** Use shareholder reserve funds from Ting's AU account ($100k AUD ≈ $108k NZD)

**Revised Financial Structure:**

**Total Opening Cash Capacity:** $200,000 (combined NZ + AU shareholder funds)
- $100k NZD (your business account)
- $100k AUD (Ting's account, shareholder funds - accessible via shareholder loan if needed)

**With AU Reserve Access:**
- Can draw up to ~$100k from AU reserve during negative months
- Final position with AU funds: +$50,507 (positive)

**Grant Application Approach:**
- State opening cash capacity: $200,000
- Provide both bank statements (NZ + AU)
- Note: Both shareholders' funds available to support R&D project
- Confirmed acceptable with Paula: Shareholder funds legitimate for co-funding capacity

---

## Alternative: Increase GP Income Year 2

**Option B (if not using AU reserve immediately):**
- Year 1: $11k/month GP income (as shown)
- Year 2: Increase to $15k-16k/month (business growth assumption)
- This would keep cashflow positive without AU funds

**Recommended:** Show $200k total capacity (NZ + AU) in application for safety buffer

---

## Important Notes

1. **Opening cash requirement:** $200,000 total capacity required
   - $100k NZD (business account)
   - $100k AUD (Ting's shareholder account, accessible via shareholder loan)

2. **Shareholder structure:** Both you and Ting are shareholders
   - Shareholder funds legitimate for co-funding per grant guidelines
   - Provide both bank statements as evidence

3. **GP income assumption:** $11k/month conservative
   - Business may grow in Year 2 (additional buffer)
   - Can increase draw if business revenue grows

4. **Grant timing critical:** 1-month lag between claim and payment
   - Must submit claims on time (end of Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24)
   - Payment delays would require drawing from AU reserve earlier

5. **Cashflow management:** 
   - Monitor monthly position
   - Draw from AU reserve as needed from Month 9 onwards
   - Repay shareholder loan from final grant if desired
