## ⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: INCREASE OPENING CASH

**Status:** With new CapDev spending ($36k vs $15k), cashflow goes negative in Months 21 and 24.

**Solution Options:**
1. **Increase opening cash to $110,000** → solves both negatives, still ends with $36.6k surplus
2. **Increase opening cash to $115,000** → provides safety buffer, ends with $41.6k surplus
3. **Use AU reserve ($100k AUD) as shareholder loan in Month 20** → preserves NZ cash, same final position

**Recommended:** Option 1 or 2 (increase opening cash to $110-115k)

**Key Factors:**
- Increased CapDev from $15k to $36k adds $21k more costs
- Heavy CapDev spending in Q1-Q2 ($27.2k in first 6 months)
- Still maintains positive final surplus
- Grant payments slightly higher ($286.6k vs $278.3k) but not enough to offset timing

**Final Position (with $110k opening):**
- Opening: $110,000
- Closing: $36,639
- **Two brief negatives (Months 21, 24) eliminated** ✓
- **AU reserve not needed** ✓

---

## Financial Structure

**Opening Cash Capacity:** $200,000 total available (if needed)
- **$110-115k NZD (business account) - RECOMMENDED** (increased from $100k due to higher CapDev)
- $100k AUD (Ting's shareholder funds) - **BACKUP AVAILABLE**

**Actual Usage (with $110k opening):**
- NZ account: $110k → $36.6k (surplus maintained)
- AU reserve: $0 drawn ✓

**Grant Application Evidence:**
- Provide NZ bank statement showing $110-115k opening balance
- Note AU reserve available as backup ($200k total capacity)
- Demonstrate strong GP income ($375k over 24 months)
- Show cashflow remains positive throughout with $110k opening

---

## Monthly Income Breakdown

**GP Revenue Pattern (varies by month, totals $375,652):**
- Conservative estimate: $15,652/month average
- Actual may vary based on clinical work volume
- Sufficient to maintain positive cashflow with grants

**GP Business Expenses (5% of revenue):**
- Total: $18,783 over 24 months
- Average: $783/month
- Covers: Practice management software, CME, professional fees, insurance

---

## Important Notes

1. **⚠️ Opening cash increased to $110-115k:** New CapDev spending ($36k) requires higher opening balance
   - With $100k opening: Cash goes negative Months 21, 24 (brief periods)
   - With $110k opening: Cash stays positive throughout ✓
   - $100k AUD (Ting's shareholder funds) available as backup if needed

2. **CapDev impact on cashflow:** $36k CapDev (vs previous $15k) adds $21k more costs
   - Heavy spending in Q1-Q2 ($27.2k in first 6 months)
   - Front-loaded IP, Patent ($7.5k), Regulatory ($15k), R&D systems ($8.5k), PM ($5k)
   - Grant coverage increases but timing creates tighter cashflow in Year 2

3. **Shareholder structure:** Both you and Ting are shareholders
   - Total capacity $200k if needed
   - Paula confirmed this structure acceptable
   - Demonstrates strong co-funding capacity

4. **GP income assumption:** $375,652 total ($15,652/month average)
   - Net of GST
   - After 5% business expenses
   - Based on realistic clinical work capacity
   - Provides stable co-funding source

5. **Grant timing:** 1-month lag between claim and payment
   - Submit claims on time (end of Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24)
   - Payment arrives following month
   - Regular grant injections maintain positive cash position

6. **Developer flexibility:**
   - Budgeted at minimum 10 hrs/week
   - Can scale up to 40 hrs/week if R&D needs require
   - Higher hours would increase costs but also increase grant (40% coverage)
   - Cashflow can absorb moderate scaling due to positive position

7. **M&C breakdown ($1,000/month):**
   - Development tools & software: $320
   - Cloud GPU inference (average): $300
   - Cloud storage, database, monitoring: $380
   - All cloud costs get 40% grant coverage

8. **Hardware strategy:**
   - Immediate expenses only: $1,800 total (Month 1: $1,000, Month 4: $800)
   - No depreciation complexity
   - GPU workstation ($11k) deferred
   - Can purchase workstation from surplus funds if needed

9. **CapDev spending timing (UPDATED - $36k total):**
   - Front-loaded: $27.2k in Months 2-6 (IP audit, patent, DPIA, LLM advisory, exp tracking, clinical safety, PM setup)
   - Mid-programme: $7.3k Months 7-12 (regulatory adviser sessions, clinical safety, PM coaching)
   - Later-stage: $1.5k Months 13-18 (ongoing regulatory, PM coaching)
   - All third-party professional services

10. **Final surplus (with $110k opening):**
    - Closing cash $36,639 after all costs
    - Can be used for:
      - Year 3 R&D continuation
      - Workstation purchase
      - Additional developer hours
      - Business growth investment

11. **Risk mitigation:**
    - AU reserve ($100k AUD) remains untouched as safety buffer
    - Can handle unexpected costs or income variations
    - Provides confidence for 24-month commitment
    - If opening cash not increased to $110k, AU reserve can cover brief negatives in Months 21-24

## Comparison: Structure Evolution

| Metric | Original (4 ppl) | v2 (3 ppl, $15k CapDev) | v3 (3 ppl, $36k CapDev) | Change |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Total eligible costs | $733,416 | $695,976 | $716,926 | +$20,950 |
| Grant (40%) | $293,366 | $278,305 | $286,609 | +$8,304 |
| Co-funding (60%) | $440,050 | $417,586 | $430,156 | +$12,570 |
| CapDev spending | N/A | $15,000 | $36,000 | +$21,000 |
| Opening cash needed | N/A | $100,000 | $110,000 | +$10,000 |
| First negative cash | Month 12 (-$12k) | Never | Month 21 (-$956) | See note* |
| AU reserve needed | Yes (~$76k) | No | No (with $110k open) | ✓ |
| Final position | -$75k (NZ only) | +$39,185 | +$36,639 | ✓ Positive |

**Note:*** With $110k opening cash, cashflow stays positive throughout. With $100k opening, brief negatives in Months 21-24.

**Result:** Higher CapDev ($36k) adds value but requires slightly higher opening cash ($110k vs $100k). Still maintains strong positive final position without needing AU reserve draw.
