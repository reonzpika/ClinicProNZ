## ⚠️ CRITICAL: CASHFLOW REQUIRES AU RESERVE FUNDS

**Problem:** With $100k NZD opening cash alone, cashflow goes negative from Month 12 onwards.

**Solution:** Use shareholder reserve funds from Ting's AU account ($100k AUD ≈ $108k NZD)

**Revised Financial Structure:**

**Total Opening Cash Capacity:** $200,000 (combined NZ + AU shareholder funds)
- $100k NZD (your business account)
- $100k AUD (Ting's account, shareholder funds - accessible via shareholder loan if needed)

**With AU Reserve Access:**
- Can draw up to ~$100k from AU reserve during negative months
- Final position with AU funds: **+$32,238** (positive after Month 25)
- Calculation: $200,000 opening - $657,366 inflows + $733,416 costs = surplus with AU funds

**Grant Application Approach:**
- State opening cash capacity: $200,000
- Provide both bank statements (NZ + AU)
- Note: Both shareholders' funds available to support R&D project
- Confirmed acceptable with Paula: Shareholder funds legitimate for co-funding capacity

---

## Cashflow With AU Reserve Access

**Using Combined $200k Opening Cash (NZ $100k + AU $100k):**

| Month | NZ Account Closing | AU Reserve Drawn | Combined Position |
|-------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Month 1-11 | Positive | $0 | Positive |
| Month 12 | -$12,370 | $12,370 | $0 |
| Month 13 | $1,471 | $12,370 | $13,841 |
| Month 14-24 | Increasingly negative | Up to $100k | Managing |
| Month 25 (Final) | -$75,762 | $75,762 drawn | $24,238 remaining |

**Final Position After All Grants:**
- Total opening capacity: $200,000
- Total AU reserve used: ~$76k
- Final surplus: **$24,238** ✓

---

## Alternative: Increase GP Income Year 2

**Option B (if wanting to minimize AU reserve draw):**
- Year 1: $11k/month GP income (as shown)
- Year 2: Increase to $14k-15k/month (business growth assumption)
- This would reduce AU reserve draw to ~$50k instead of $76k

**Recommended:** Show $200k total capacity (NZ + AU) in application for safety buffer

---

## Important Notes

1. **Opening cash requirement:** $200,000 total capacity required
   - $100k NZD (business account)
   - $100k AUD (Ting's shareholder account, accessible via shareholder loan)
   - Paula confirmed this structure is acceptable

2. **Shareholder structure:** Both you and Ting are shareholders
   - Shareholder funds legitimate for co-funding per grant guidelines
   - Provide both bank statements as evidence
   - Shareholder loan structure if drawing from AU account

3. **GP income assumption:** $11k/month conservative
   - Business may grow in Year 2 (additional buffer)
   - Can increase draw if business revenue grows
   - Flexibility in co-funding source

4. **Grant timing critical:** 1-month lag between claim and payment
   - Must submit claims on time (end of Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24)
   - Payment delays would require drawing from AU reserve earlier
   - Build buffer by submitting claims early in claim month

5. **Cashflow management:** 
   - Monitor monthly position closely
   - Draw from AU reserve as needed from Month 12 onwards
   - Repay shareholder loan from final grant if desired
   - Final position positive with AU reserve: +$24,238

6. **Developer flexibility:**
   - Budgeted at minimum 10 hrs/week each
   - Can scale up to 40 hrs/week if R&D needs require
   - Higher hours would increase costs but also increase grant (40% coverage)
   - Cashflow would need additional AU reserve draw if scaling up significantly

7. **M&C breakdown ($1,000/month):**
   - Development tools & software: $320
   - Cloud GPU inference (average): $300
   - Cloud storage, database, monitoring: $380
   - All cloud costs get 40% grant coverage (better than workstation depreciation)

8. **Hardware strategy:**
   - Immediate expenses only: $1,800 total (Month 1: $1,000, Month 4: $800)
   - No depreciation complexity
   - GPU workstation ($11k) deferred - using cloud GPU provides better grant coverage (40% vs 26.7%)
   - Can purchase workstation with co-funding or post-grant if cloud proves insufficient

9. **CapDev spending timing:**
   - Front-loaded: $11k in Months 2-6 (IP audit, patent, gap analysis, adviser setup)
   - Ongoing: $4k spread Months 6-24 (regulatory adviser sessions)
   - All third-party professional services (no internal labour counted)
