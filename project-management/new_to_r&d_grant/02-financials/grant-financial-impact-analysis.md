# Grant Financial Impact Analysis
## Critical Question: How Much More Money Do I Actually Make With the Grant?

**Document Purpose:** Answer the question Helen (accountant) should have answered but didn't: What's the real financial benefit of the grant after accounting for all taxes and costs?

**Last Updated:** 2 December 2025

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line Answer Needed:**

| Scenario | Personal Income (After Tax) | Net Benefit |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **A: With Grant** | **[NEEDS CALCULATION]** | **Baseline** |
| **B: Without Grant** | **[NEEDS CALCULATION]** | **± [DIFFERENCE]** |

**Status:** ⚠️ **CALCULATION INCOMPLETE** - This analysis requires detailed tax calculations that were NOT provided by Helen.

## Why This Question Matters

**Decision criteria:** If the grant only increases personal after-tax income by $20k over 24 months, is it worth:
- 2 years of compliance burden
- Quarterly reporting requirements
- Risk of grant clawback if milestones missed
- Restriction on business decisions during grant period

**Need to know:** The financial breakeven point and opportunity cost of taking the grant.

## Scenario A: With Grant (24 Months)

### Income Sources
- GP clinical income: $266,800 (excl. GST)
- R&D Grant received: $286,770 (40% of costs)
- **Total business income: $553,570**

### Business Costs (R&D)
- Founder salary (PAYE): $299,520
- Ting salary (PAYE): $290,640
- Developer contractor: $65,016
- CapDev: $36,000
- M&C: $25,750
- **Total R&D costs: $716,926**

### Business Financial Position
- Total income: $553,570
- Total costs: $716,926
- **Business loss: -$163,356**

### Personal Position (Founder)
- Salary received (before tax): $299,520 over 24 months
- Monthly: $12,480
- Annual equivalent: $149,760/year

**Tax Calculation Required:**
- Personal income tax on $149,760/year
- Less: Tax credits from business losses (if applicable)
- Less: R&D tax incentives (15% credit = ~$107,539 potential)
- **= Net personal after-tax income [NEEDS CALCULATION]**

### Ting's Position
- Salary received (before tax): $290,640 over 24 months
- Monthly: $12,110
- Annual equivalent: $145,320/year

**Tax Calculation Required:**
- Personal income tax on $145,320/year
- **= Net personal after-tax income [NEEDS CALCULATION]**

### Shareholder Funds Used
- Opening cash: $100,000
- Ting's reserve: $100,000
- **Total shareholder investment: $200,000**

---

## Scenario B: Without Grant (Alternative)

### What Would You Do Instead?

**Option B1: Continue ClinicPro Operations Only (No R&D)**
- GP work: Increase to 40 hrs/week (currently 20 hrs/week)
- Additional GP income: $266,800/year × 2 years = $533,600
- Business costs: Minimal (existing ClinicPro operations)
- Shareholder funds: Retained ($200,000 not deployed)

**Personal income:**
- GP income: $533,600 over 24 months
- Less business expenses: [MINIMAL]
- Less personal income tax: [NEEDS CALCULATION]
- **= Net after-tax income [NEEDS CALCULATION]**

**Option B2: Do R&D Without Grant**
- Self-fund R&D fully ($716,926)
- Use shareholder funds ($200,000) + need additional $516,926
- GP income: $266,800 (20 hrs/week, same as Scenario A)
- Total outflow: $716,926
- Total inflow: $266,800
- **Net position: -$450,126 (shareholder funds depleted + debt)**

**Option B3: Reduce R&D Scope**
- Do R&D part-time without salaries
- Bootstrap approach: founder works unpaid, minimal costs
- No formal team structure
- **Personal income: GP only ($266,800 over 24 months)**

## What Helen Should Have Calculated

### Tax Analysis Needed (Not Provided)

**1. Personal Tax Position With Grant:**
- Founder income: $299,520 over 24 months
- Tax at marginal rate (approx 33%): ~$98,842
- Less: R&D tax credits if applicable
- Less: Loss tax credit cashout if applicable
- **Net after-tax: [NEEDS CALCULATION]**

**2. Personal Tax Position Without Grant (Option B1 - Full GP Work):**
- GP income: $533,600 over 24 months
- Tax at marginal rate (approx 39% top bracket): ~$208,000
- **Net after-tax: [NEEDS CALCULATION]**

**3. Real Financial Comparison:**

| Scenario | Gross Income | After-Tax Income | Shareholder Funds Used | **Net Position** |
|----------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| A: With Grant | $299,520 | **[CALC NEEDED]** | $200,000 | **[CALC NEEDED]** |
| B1: Full GP Work | $533,600 | **[CALC NEEDED]** | $0 | **[CALC NEEDED]** |
| B2: Self-Fund R&D | $266,800 | **[CALC NEEDED]** | $450,126+ | **[CALC NEEDED]** |

### Additional Considerations

**Time Value:**
- Scenario A: 30 hrs/week R&D + 20 hrs/week GP = 50 hrs/week
- Scenario B1: 40 hrs/week GP = 40 hrs/week (10 hrs/week free time!)

**Opportunity Cost:**
- With grant: Build R&D product, potential future revenue unclear
- Without grant: Higher immediate income, more free time, retained capital

**Risk Assessment:**
- With grant: 2-year commitment, milestone risk, compliance burden
- Without grant: Flexibility, no obligations

## Questions Helen Should Have Answered (But Didn't)

1. **What's my total personal tax liability for 24 months under Scenario A vs B?**

2. **How do R&D tax incentives (15% credit + loss cashout) affect my personal tax position?**

3. **What's the company's tax position each year? (Grant income - R&D costs across 3 financial years)**

4. **Do business losses flow through to personal tax for shareholder-employees?**

5. **What's the after-tax return on the $200,000 shareholder investment?**

6. **At what point does the grant become financially beneficial vs just working more GP hours?**

7. **What are the provisional tax implications for Year 2 and Year 3?**

8. **How does Ting's tax position change? (She's going from $0 income to $145,320/year)**

9. **What's the ACC levy impact on both salaries?**

10. **Is there a better structure (trust, holding company, etc.) that improves tax efficiency?**

---

## Action Required

**To complete this analysis, we need Helen (or another accountant) to provide:**

1. **Full tax calculation for Scenario A:**
   - Personal income tax (both founder + Ting)
   - Company tax position (3 financial years)
   - R&D tax credit benefit (~$107,539)
   - Loss tax cashout benefit (if applicable)
   - ACC levies
   - Net after-tax position for founder

2. **Full tax calculation for Scenario B1:**
   - Personal income tax on $533,600 GP income
   - Company tax position (minimal operations)
   - Net after-tax position for founder

3. **Comparison table showing:**
   - Net personal income after all taxes (A vs B1)
   - Net position including shareholder funds used
   - Break-even analysis
   - Recommendation: Is grant financially worthwhile?

## Provisional Estimates (Rough, Unverified)

**WARNING:** These are rough estimates without proper tax calculations. Do NOT rely on these for decisions.

### Scenario A: With Grant (Rough Estimate)

**Founder personal income:**
- Gross: $299,520 over 24 months
- Tax (33% marginal): ~-$98,842
- R&D tax credit (15% of $716,926): +$107,539 (IF available to shareholder personally)
- **Net after-tax: ~$308,217** (ROUGH ESTIMATE)

**Less shareholder funds deployed:** -$100,000 (founder's portion)

**Net position: ~$208,217 over 24 months** (~$8,676/month)

### Scenario B1: Full GP Work (Rough Estimate)

**Founder personal income:**
- Gross: $533,600 over 24 months (40 hrs/week @ $145/hr)
- Tax (39% top bracket): ~-$208,000
- **Net after-tax: ~$325,600** (ROUGH ESTIMATE)

**Shareholder funds retained:** +$100,000 (not deployed)

**Net position: ~$425,600 over 24 months** (~$17,733/month)

### Rough Comparison (UNVERIFIED)

| Metric | With Grant | Without Grant (Full GP) | Difference |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|------------|
| After-tax income | ~$308,217 | ~$325,600 | -$17,383 |
| Shareholder funds | -$100,000 | $0 | -$100,000 |
| **Net position** | **~$208,217** | **~$425,600** | **-$217,383** |
| Hours/week | 50 hrs | 40 hrs | +10 hrs/week |

**Implication (if estimates accurate):** You'd be ~$217k WORSE OFF financially by taking the grant, while working 10 hrs/week MORE.

**Why take the grant then?**
- Build IP/product with future revenue potential
- Validate technology for future funding rounds
- Strategic positioning (not immediate financial benefit)

**BUT:** These estimates are rough and may be significantly wrong. Need proper accountant calculations.

## Next Steps

1. **Send this document to Helen** with specific questions listed above

2. **Request formal comparison:** "Please calculate my net after-tax personal income for both scenarios, including all tax credits and implications"

3. **If Helen can't/won't do this:** Engage a different accountant who specializes in R&D tax

4. **Decision point:** Only proceed with grant if:
   - Net financial benefit is positive, OR
   - Strategic benefit (IP, future revenue) justifies financial cost

## Lesson Applied

**This document demonstrates the critical question framework:**
- ✅ Specific, actionable question defined upfront
- ✅ Decision criteria clear (need to know net benefit)
- ✅ Detailed scenarios laid out for comparison
- ✅ Exact calculations requested

**This is what we should have sent to Helen initially.**
