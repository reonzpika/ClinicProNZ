## Quick Reference: Key Tax Facts

### GST on R&D Wages: NO ❌
**Question:** Do I pay GST when my company pays me wages for R&D work?
**Answer:** **NO.** Wages are NOT subject to GST in New Zealand. Only supplies of goods/services attract GST.

### Double GST: NO ❌
**Question:** Do I pay GST twice (once for R&D wages, once for GP work)?
**Answer:** **NO.** Only GP work invoices include GST. R&D wages are GST-free.

### PAYE Required: YES ✅
**Question:** Does Callaghan Innovation require PAYE for shareholder-employees?
**Answer:** **YES.** Callaghan does NOT accept drawings/dividends as eligible labour costs. Shareholder-employees working on R&D must be paid via PAYE with proper payroll records.

**GST does NOT apply to:**
- ❌ Wages paid to employees (including shareholder-employees)
- ❌ Salary/PAYE payments

**Filing frequency:**
- **Bi-monthly** if turnover >$500k
- **Your situation:** GP income $375k + grant income $278k = $653k → bi-monthly returns required
- Filing months: Jan/Feb, Mar/Apr, May/Jun, Jul/Aug, Sep/Oct, Nov/Dec
- Due date: 28th of following month

**Grant GST invoicing:**
- When you claim $83,270 eligible costs:

### 3. ACC Levies ⚠️ CHECK WITH ACCOUNTANT

**What:** Accident Compensation Corporation levies (compulsory accident insurance)

**Applies to:**
- All PAYE wages (employees including shareholder-employees)
- Contractor wages (if contractor NOT ACC-exempt)

**Estimated cost:**
- Rate: ~1.39% of liable earnings (varies by business activity classification)
- Founder wages ($299,520) × 1.39% = ~$4,162
- Ting wages ($290,640) × 1.39% = ~$4,040
- **Total: ~$8,200 over 24 months (~$342/month)**

**Grant eligibility:**
- ❌ **NOT grant-eligible** (co-funding cost only)
- Will reduce final surplus by ~$8,200

**Action:**
- **Confirm with accountant:** Exact ACC levy rate for your business activity code
- Budget for ~$342/month co-funding cost (not included in current cashflow)
- File annual ACC return and pay levies as invoiced by ACC

---

### 4. KiwiSaver ✅ NOT ENROLLED

**What:** Voluntary retirement savings scheme

**Status:** Neither Founder nor Ting enrolled during R&D project

**If enrolled (you're NOT):**
- Employee contribution: 3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10% of gross pay
- Employer contribution: 3% of gross pay (mandatory)
- Cost if enrolled: ~$17,700 over 24 months

**Your decision:** ✅ Not enrolling = saves ~$17,700 co-funding

**Action:** No action required (not enrolled)

---

### 5. Provisional Tax ✅ HANDLING SEPARATELY

**What:** Advance payments of income tax for companies/self-employed

**When required:** If residual income tax (RIT) >$5,000 in previous year

**Your situation:** With $375k GP income, you'll exceed the threshold

**Payment dates:**
- 1st installment: 28 August
- 2nd installment: 15 January
- 3rd installment: 7 May
- Terminal tax: 7 April (following year, when annual return filed)

**Action:** Accountant to calculate provisional tax payments (you're handling this separately)

---

### 6. Company Income Tax ✅ AWARE

**What:** 28% tax on company profits

**Your situation during R&D project:**
- GP income: $375,652
- Less: Wages to Founder + Ting ($590,160)
- Less: GP business expenses ($18,783)
- Less: Other company costs (ACC, etc.)
- = **Likely TAX LOSS** (wages exceed income)

**Result:**
- Probably **no company tax payable** during 24-month R&D project
- Tax losses can be carried forward to offset future profits
- This is normal and acceptable for R&D-intensive companies

**Action:**
- File annual company tax return (IR4) even if loss position
- Accountant to prepare annual accounts and tax return

---

### 7. FBT (Fringe Benefit Tax) ✅ NO BENEFITS

**What:** Tax on non-cash benefits provided to employees

**Common FBT triggers:**
- Company car (private use)
- Low-interest loans to employees
- Free/discounted goods or services
- Employer-provided accommodation

**Your situation:**
- Home office: Used exclusively for R&D work ✅ (no FBT)
- Hardware (RAM, monitor, iPhone): Business use only ✅ (no FBT)
- No company car, loans, or other benefits ✅

**Action:** No FBT returns required (no benefits provided)

- Use template from `/05-claims-and-tracking/templates/`

---

### 9. Developer Contractor Status ⚠️ CLARIFY GST

**Your developer:** $72/hour (contractor), starts Month 4

**Question:** Is the developer GST-registered?

**If GST-registered:**
- You pay: $72/hour + 15% GST = **$82.80/hour total**
- Developer invoices you with GST
- You claim back the GST (input tax credit) in your GST returns
- Grant-eligible cost remains: $72/hour (excl. GST)
- **No impact on grant budget** ✅

**If NOT GST-registered:**
- You pay: $72/hour flat (no GST)
- Grant-eligible cost: $72/hour
- Simpler invoicing

**Action:** Confirm developer's GST registration status before contracting

## Summary: What You're Paying GST On

| Item | GST? | Explanation |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Your R&D wages** | ❌ NO | Wages are not subject to GST |
| **Ting's R&D wages** | ❌ NO | Wages are not subject to GST |
| **Developer contractor invoices** | ✅ YES (if registered) | Contractor supplies services → GST applies (you claim it back) |
| **GP clinical work invoices** | ✅ YES | You charge patients/ACC 15% GST |
| **Grant payments from Callaghan** | ✅ YES | You charge Callaghan 15% GST on grant amount |
| **Cloud hosting subscriptions** | ✅ YES | Suppliers charge you GST (you claim it back) |
| **Hardware purchases** | ✅ YES | Retailers charge you GST (you claim it back) |
| **IP attorney fees** | ✅ YES | Professional charges GST (you claim it back) |
| **Regulatory adviser fees** | ✅ YES | Professional charges GST (you claim it back) |

**Key insight:** You charge GST on your outputs (GP work, grant payments) and claim back GST on your inputs (expenses). The net difference is what you pay to (or claim from) IRD.

## No Double GST ✓

**Your concern:** "Do I pay GST twice - once for R&D hours and once for GP work?"

**Answer:** **NO.** Here's why:

**Scenario 1: R&D Wages (NO GST)**
- Company earns GP income: $15,652 + GST
- Company pays you R&D wages: $12,480 (NO GST)
- Result: GST paid only once (on GP income)

**Scenario 2: Grant Income (YES GST, but claimed back)**
- Company claims R&D costs: $27,686 (excl. GST)
- Callaghan pays 40% grant: $11,074 + GST = $12,735
- You collect the GST ($1,661) and pay it to IRD
- But you've also paid GST on your expenses (input tax)
- Net effect: GST roughly washes out (you claim back what you paid)

**Conclusion:** Only ONE layer of GST on your GP work. Grant GST is neutral (collect and pay, but claim back inputs).

## Updated Cashflow Impact

**Original closing balance:** $39,185 (Month 25)

**Adjusted for ACC levies:**
- Less: ACC levies (~$8,200)
- **New closing balance: ~$31,000** ✓

**Still positive throughout ✓**

**KiwiSaver savings:**
- Not enrolled = saves ~$17,700 vs if enrolled
