## Rationale for Changes

### 1. Reduced GP Hours (30 → 20 hrs/week):
**Benefit:** Makes 30 hrs/week R&D commitment more believable
- **Before:** 60 hrs/week total (30 GP + 30 R&D) - very demanding
- **After:** 50 hrs/week total (20 GP + 30 R&D) - sustainable

**For Application:** Demonstrates realistic work capacity and serious R&D commitment

### 2. Increased Opening Cash ($100k → $218k):
**Benefit:** Strengthens co-funding position and eliminates cashflow negatives
- **Before:** Cash went negative in Months 21-24, needed AU reserve
- **After:** Cash stays positive throughout, comfortable buffer

**Source:** $200,000 AUD shareholder funds = $218,000 NZD
- Available immediately
- Demonstrates strong financial position
- No need for AU reserve fallback

### 3. Loss Tax Credit Optimization:
**Household Cash Analysis (over 24 months):**

**With 30 hrs GP work:**
- GP income: $380k (30 hrs/week)
- Loss tax credit: ~$14k (small loss)
- **Total household benefit: ~$81k**

**With 20 hrs GP work:** ✅ CURRENT STRUCTURE
- GP income: $267k (20 hrs/week)
- Loss tax credit: ~$49k (larger loss from lower GP income)
- **Total household benefit: ~$209k** 🏆

**Result:** 20 hrs GP work generates **$128k MORE household cash** than 30 hrs GP work!
- Work less, earn more (due to grant + loss tax credit)
- Better work/life balance
- More time for quality R&D

## Application Narrative

### How to Present This:

**Co-Funding Structure:**
> "Co-funding ($430,156) is provided from shareholder funds ($218,000 opening cash) and ongoing GP clinical practice income ($266,800 over 24 months). Founder maintains 20 hrs/week GP practice work alongside 30 hrs/week R&D commitment (50 hrs/week total). This structure ensures sustainable workload while demonstrating strong financial capacity to complete the 24-month R&D programme."

**Workload Credibility:**
> "Founder's 30 hrs/week R&D commitment is realistic alongside 20 hrs/week GP clinical work (50 hrs/week total). This reduced GP workload from current full-time practice enables deep focus on R&D while maintaining business income and staying connected to clinical realities."

## Tax Optimization Summary

### R&D Loss Tax Credit Potential:
- **Total R&D costs:** $716,926
- **Grant income (taxable):** $286,770
- **GP income:** $266,800
- **Business tax loss:** ~$163k over 24 months
- **Loss tax credit (28%):** ~$46-49k (can only claim on co-funded portion $430k)
- **Maximum available:** $120k/year cap ($240k over 24 months)

### Key Tax Points:
1. Loss tax credit = interest-free loan, not free money
2. Pay it back later via higher tax when profitable
3. **Total tax paid same, just timing difference**
4. Can only claim on co-funded portion (NOT grant-funded)
5. Must apply by June 30 each year (Years 1 & 2)

**For Helen (Accountant):**
- Company will show tax loss due to lower GP income
- Enables R&D loss tax credit claim (~$46-49k)
- Grant income is taxable ($287k over 24 months)
- Personal tax increases for Ryo + Ting (~$7,894/month PAYE each)
