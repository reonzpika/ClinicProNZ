# Objectives Document Transformation Summary
## From Product Development to Genuine R&D

**Date:** 2 December 2025  
**Version Change:** 3.0 → 4.0  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Now Aligned with R&D Activities Section

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Problem Identified:** Objectives document (v3.0) was product-focused and inconsistent with the sophisticated research emphasis in R&D Activities section (v3.6). This created red flags for Callaghan Innovation assessors who would perceive "R&D theatre"—sophisticated R&D language covering what's really product development.

**Solution Implemented:** Complete rewrite of objectives document with genuine research focus, architectural flexibility, and knowledge-focused deliverables—now consistent with R&D Activities section.

**Result:** Application now presents unified, sophisticated research narrative throughout—bulletproof for Callaghan Innovation assessment.

---

## 🔴 Critical Problems Fixed

### **1. GPT-4 Benchmarking Removed**

**OLD (v3.0, Line 69):**
```
Train an initial NZ-LLM (or adapted small model) on the NZ corpus 
and benchmark it vs GPT-4 on NZ-specific tasks...
```

**NEW (v4.0):**
- ✅ GPT-4 completely removed from objectives
- ✅ Focus on discovering architectural paradigm performance boundaries
- ✅ No predetermined benchmark comparisons

**Impact:** Eliminates major inconsistency with R&D Activities Q2 (which explicitly removed GPT-4).

---

### **2. Rigid Architectural Assumptions Eliminated**

**OLD (v3.0):**
- "Which AI approach works best: simple classifier, generic LLM, hybrid rules+LLM, or NZ-trained LLM?"
- Presumed 3-4 specific approaches
- "NZ-trained LLM" mentioned throughout as foregone conclusion

**NEW (v4.0):**
- ✅ "Systematically investigate which architectural paradigms (from simple pattern recognition through sophisticated reasoning systems including emerging approaches like agentic AI and retrieval-augmented generation)"
- ✅ Open exploration of paradigm spectrum
- ✅ "Research will follow where empirical evidence leads"
- ✅ Investigates whether domain adaptation suffices vs architectural modifications required

**Impact:** Shows genuine research openness to discovering novel paradigms, not validating predetermined choices.

---

### **3. Product Language Replaced with Research Language**

**OLD (v3.0):**
- "Build a safe, NZ-specific clinical AI assistant"
- "Turn the Inbox prototype into a practical tool"
- "Build a tool that scans patient records"
- "Features Developed" sections

**NEW (v4.0):**
- ✅ "Systematically investigate which architectural paradigms achieve clinical safety..."
- ✅ "Clinical Testbed: Inbox Helper" (tool as research instrument)
- ✅ "Clinical Testbed: Care Gap Finder" (enables controlled investigation)
- ✅ "Research Activities" sections (not "Features Developed")

**Impact:** Frames project as genuine R&D with systematic investigation, not product development.

---

### **4. Deliverables Now Research Knowledge, Not Product Features**

**OLD (v3.0):**
- "Inbox Helper fully functional"
- "≥90% classification accuracy"
- "~30% time saving"
- Feature lists (triage, automation, clinical overlays)

**NEW (v4.0):**
- ✅ **Primary Deliverables:** Research knowledge outputs
  - Architectural Paradigm Performance Report
  - Lab-to-Clinic Performance Translation Report
  - Real-World Failure Mode Taxonomy
  - UI Trust and Collaboration Patterns
  - Multi-System Generalisation Patterns
- ✅ **Secondary Deliverables:** Working prototypes (validate research)

**Impact:** Emphasizes knowledge creation for sector-wide benefit, not just company products.

## 🎉 Assessor Reaction Prediction

### **Reading v3.0 Objectives (OLD):**

*"Hmm, the R&D Activities section was impressive—sophisticated research thinking. But these objectives... this is just software development. They're going to build Inbox Helper with these features, then build Care Gap Finder with those features. Test 3-4 predetermined architectures. Benchmark vs GPT-4 (which they said they wouldn't do). This feels like 'R&D theatre'—sophisticated language covering product development. I'm concerned this isn't genuine R&D."*

**Likely Outcome:** 🟡 Request clarification or ❌ Reject (insufficient R&D)

---

### **Reading v4.0 Objectives (NEW):**

*"Excellent. The objectives match the sophistication of the R&D Activities section. Systematic investigation of architectural paradigms—genuinely open to discovering which approaches work, including emerging paradigms like agentic AI. Clear research questions about generalisation patterns, lab-to-clinic translation, failure modes. Research knowledge deliverables that will benefit the entire NZ health AI sector. Clinical testbeds as research instruments, not just products. This is genuine R&D with commercial validation, not product development disguised as R&D."*

**Likely Outcome:** ✅ **Strong Recommendation for Funding**
