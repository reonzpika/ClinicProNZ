## Why This Is Perfect Timing

### **1. They're Actively Interested**
- ✅ Comprehensive Care sent a survey on **31 Oct 2025** asking about AI and clinical scribing tools
- ✅ Survey deadline: **21 November 2025** (perfect timing - before grant submission)
- ✅ Shows they're actively evaluating AI solutions for their network

### **2. Significant Scale & Impact**
- **42+ practices** in their network
- **400+ GPs & Nurses**
- **200,000+ patients**
- **400,000+ consultations/year**
- This represents **~8% of NZ's GP workforce** (400 out of ~5,000 GPs)

### **3. Strategic Alignment**
- Your grant application already mentions **PHO partnerships** as a go-to-market channel (Section 4.2)
- Comprehensive Care focuses on **"tools, support and resources"** for practices - exactly what you're building
- They emphasize **clinical quality, care gaps, and outcomes** - aligns with your use cases (especially care gap monitoring)

### **4. Market Validation Gold**
- **Third-party validation** from a major PHO (stronger than individual GP letters)
- Shows **institutional demand** (not just individual GPs)
- Demonstrates **real-world partnership potential** (not theoretical)

## Draft Email to Colleen Hardiman (Conversational Approach)

**Subject:** Re: AI Survey - Would love to discuss!

Hi Colleen,

I got really excited when I saw your email about the AI and clinical scribing survey! 

I'm a GP in your network and actually building ClinicPro (AI scribe currently in partnership with Medtech for integration). I'm applying for a Callaghan Innovation R&D grant to expand it beyond scribing to cover inbox management, clinical coding, referral quality, and care gap monitoring - basically the workflows causing the most GP burnout.

Would love to chat about this if you have time.

I'm also getting a supporting letter from Medtech for the grant application, and it would really strengthen the application if I could get one from Comprehensive Care too. Nothing binding - just expressing interest in exploring pilots with your network practices once the R&D is complete.

Let me know if you'd be open to a quick chat?

Thanks,
Ryo

## Alternative: Even More Casual

**Subject:** Excited to see your AI survey!

Hi Colleen,

Perfect timing on your AI/scribing survey! 

I'm a GP in your network building ClinicPro (AI scribe with Medtech partnership). I'm applying for a Callaghan Innovation R&D grant to expand it to four GP workflows: inbox management, clinical coding, referral quality, and care gap monitoring.

Would love to discuss how this could help Comprehensive Care practices - especially the care gap monitoring piece for PHO quality outcomes.

Medtech is writing a supporting letter for the grant application. Would really strengthen it if Comprehensive Care could provide one too - just expressing interest in future pilots, nothing binding.

Open to a quick chat if you have time?

Thanks,
Ryo

## Strategic Value for Grant Application

### **Strengthens Market Validation (Currently 4/10)**

**What This Adds:**
1. **Institutional demand** - PHO-level interest (stronger than individual GP letters)
2. **Scale validation** - 400+ GPs, 42+ practices = significant market
3. **Outcomes alignment** - Shows understanding of PHO quality metrics (care gaps, referrals)
4. **Partnership depth** - Not just sandbox access (Medtech), but actual pilot pathway (PHO)

### **Addresses Critical Gaps:**

✅ **Market Validation Gap:**
- Currently: "No letters of interest from GPs"
- With Comprehensive Care: PHO-level support letter (even stronger than individual GP letters)

✅ **Commercialization Strategy:**
- Your GTM plan already mentions PHO partnerships (Section 4.2)
- This validates that pathway with a real, interested PHO

✅ **Community Impact:**
- Comprehensive Care serves 200,000+ patients
- Demonstrates broader health equity impact (not just individual practices)

## Other Organizations to Consider

### **1. Other PHOs (If You Have Connections)**
- **Pinnacle Midlands Health Network** - Large PHO, mentioned in your proposal
- **ProCare** - Auckland-based, significant scale
- **Any PHO where you have contacts** - Even a brief letter helps

**Approach:** Similar to Comprehensive Care - focus on outcomes alignment (care gaps, quality metrics)

### **2. RNZCGP (Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners)**
- **Why:** They represent NZ GPs, conduct workforce surveys (cited in your proposal)
- **What to ask:** Letter of support or interest in the R&D project
- **Value:** Professional body endorsement

**Approach:** Emphasize workforce sustainability, burnout reduction, GP wellbeing

### **3. HealthPathways (If Regional)**
- **Why:** Your referral quality use case directly uses HealthPathways criteria
- **What to ask:** Brief letter confirming understanding of HealthPathways integration
- **Value:** Validates technical feasibility of referral checking use case

**Approach:** Technical - show how you'll integrate HealthPathways criteria checking

### **4. BPAC (Best Practice Advocacy Centre)**
- **Why:** You're using BPAC guidelines for care gap monitoring
- **What to ask:** Brief letter confirming alignment with BPAC guidance
- **Value:** Clinical credibility, validates care gap monitoring use case

**Approach:** Clinical - emphasize adherence to BPAC guidelines

## Recommended Priority

### **High Priority (Do This Week):**
1. ✅ **Comprehensive Care** - Perfect timing, significant scale, active interest
2. ✅ **Complete their survey** (if you haven't already) - Shows engagement

### **Medium Priority (If Time Permits):**
3. **RNZCGP** - Professional body endorsement (if you have contacts)
4. **Other PHOs** - If you have connections (even brief letters help)

### **Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
5. **HealthPathways** - Technical validation (may be overkill for grant application)
6. **BPAC** - Clinical validation (may be overkill for grant application)

---

## Action Plan

### **This Week:**
1. ✅ **Send email to Colleen** (use draft above)
2. ✅ **Complete Comprehensive Care survey** (if not done already) - Mention your R&D project in comments
3. ✅ **Follow up if no response by 20 Nov** (before survey deadline)

### **Next Week:**
4. ✅ **If Colleen responds positively:** Request brief letter/email confirmation
5. ✅ **If no response:** Follow up politely (they're busy with survey analysis)

### **Before Submission (Mid-December):**
6. ✅ **Include Comprehensive Care letter** in grant application
7. ✅ **Update market validation section** to mention PHO partnership interest

- **Impact:** Market validation score improves from 4/10 to 7-8/10

### **Good Case:**

- Confirms interest in future discussions (post-grant)
- **Impact:** Market validation score improves from 4/10 to 6/10

### **Acceptable Case:**

## Notes

- **Don't over-commit:** This is for grant application purposes - no binding commitments
- **Be flexible:** They may want to discuss further before providing letter
- **Timing is good:** Survey shows active interest, grant application deadline gives urgency
- **You're a member:** Being a GP in their network gives credibility
