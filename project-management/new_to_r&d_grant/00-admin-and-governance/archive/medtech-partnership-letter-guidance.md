## Draft Follow-Up Email

**Subject:** Re: Partnership Letter - Helpful Context for Grant Application

Hi Alex,

Thanks for the quick response! Really appreciate you taking this on.

For context, **inbox management** is one of the two key use cases in our R&D grant application (alongside care gap monitoring). I watched your recent webinar where you mentioned that lots of GPs are wanting AI inbox management - if that's something you could briefly mention in the letter, it would really strengthen our market validation section.

**What would be helpful to include** (if appropriate):
- Medtech supports this R&D project
- Sandbox/testing environment access
- Potential for future integration/pilot opportunities
- **Brief mention that GPs are expressing demand for AI inbox management solutions** (if this aligns with what you're hearing)

No pressure on exact wording - whatever works for your approval process. The main thing is confirming Medtech's support and sandbox access.

**Deadline:** We're aiming to submit by **mid-December 2025** if possible, but I understand you need to get approvals. No rush - the main thing is getting it right.

Happy to discuss further if needed.

Thanks again,
Ryo

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Collaborative tone** - "if that's something you could briefly mention" vs dictating exact wording
2. **Provides context** - Explains why inbox management is important to the grant
3. **References factual evidence** - The webinar (shows it's not fabricated)
4. **Flexible** - "if appropriate" and "if this aligns" gives Alex an out
5. **Clear priorities** - Still emphasizes the core requirements (support, sandbox, opportunities)
6. **Deadline transparency** - Helps Alex prioritize if needed

## Strategic Value

**Why mentioning GP demand for AI inbox management helps:**

1. **Third-party validation** - Medtech (with 3,000+ GP access) confirming demand is stronger than self-reported surveys
2. **Aligns with grant focus** - Inbox management is Use Case #1 in the R&D proposal
3. **Addresses critical gap** - Market validation is currently 4/10; this would significantly strengthen it
4. **Shows partnership depth** - Medtech understands the market need, not just providing sandbox access
5. **Webinar evidence** - The user watched the webinar, so this is factual, not fabricated

## Alternative Approach (If Alex Pushes Back)

If Alex says she can't include specific use cases in the letter, that's fine. The core requirements (support, sandbox, opportunities) are what matter most. The inbox management mention is a "nice to have" that strengthens the application but isn't essential.
