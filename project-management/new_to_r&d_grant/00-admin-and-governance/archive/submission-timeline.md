# Grant Application Submission Timeline

**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Project Start Date:** 27 January 2026  
**Status:** Planning submission deadline

---

## Recommended Submission Deadline

### **Target: Mid-December 2025 (around 15-20 December)**

**Rationale:**
- Allows 6-8 weeks before project start (27 Jan 2026) for Callaghan review/approval process
- Gives time to incorporate mentor feedback (meeting 12 Nov)
- Accounts for Medtech letter timeline (Alex said "next week" = ~20 Nov)
- Provides buffer for final review, proofreading, and gap-filling

## Critical Path Items

### **Must Have Before Submission:**

1. ✅ **Medtech Partnership Letter** (~20 Nov)
   - Status: Alex said "next week"
   - Action: Send follow-up email with inbox management context

2. ✅ **Mentor Feedback Incorporated** (after 12 Nov)
   - Status: Meeting scheduled
   - Action: Update proposal based on feedback

3. ✅ **Callaghan Requirements Clarified** (after 13 Nov)
   - Status: Meeting scheduled with Paul
   - Action: Ensure proposal meets all requirements

4. ✅ **Critical Gaps Filled:**
   - [ ] "Why Grant Funding is Essential" paragraph
   - [x] Commercialization strategy section (created, may need updates)
   - [ ] Community impact section
   - [ ] Competitor analysis table (if recommended)

5. ✅ **Supporting Documents Complete:**
   - [ ] ClinicPro evidence document (screenshots, metrics)
   - [ ] Financial evidence (bank statement, YTD P&L/Balance Sheet)
   - [ ] GP letters of interest (if recommended - currently optional)

## Risk Factors

### **Potential Delays:**

1. **Medtech Letter Delay**
   - Risk: Alex's "next week" could slip if approvals take longer
   - Mitigation: Follow up politely if not received by 25 Nov
   - Buffer: Can submit without it if absolutely necessary (but weakens application)

2. **Mentor Feedback Complexity**
   - Risk: Mentor may request significant changes
   - Mitigation: Prioritize critical feedback; defer "nice to have" improvements
   - Buffer: 1-2 weeks allocated for incorporation

3. **Callaghan Requirements**
   - Risk: Paul may identify missing requirements
   - Mitigation: Address immediately after meeting
   - Buffer: 2 weeks allocated for updates

4. **GP Letters of Interest**
   - Risk: Takes time to get GP responses
   - Mitigation: Currently optional; only pursue if mentor strongly recommends
   - Buffer: Can submit without if not critical

---

## Alternative Timeline (If Delays Occur)

### **Latest Realistic Submission: Early January 2026 (around 8-10 Jan)**

**If delays occur:**
- Still allows 2-3 weeks for Callaghan review before project start
- Callaghan can approve "in principle" with up to 6 months to secure co-funding
- Project start date (27 Jan) may need to be flexible if approval pending

**Risk:** Tighter timeline, less buffer for approval process
