## [3.2] - 2025-12-01

### Changed - Financial Structure Optimization
**Major financial restructuring for optimal cashflow management and believable work commitment:**

#### Financial Structure
- **Two-account structure implemented:** $100,000 business account + $100,000 Ting's reserve account
- **Strategic drawdown plan created:** Ting's reserve drawn in 4 installments at Months 9, 12, 15, 18 ($30k, $30k, $25k, $15k)
- **Drawdown timing:** Coordinates with 1-month grant payment lag to maintain positive cashflow
- **Final balance:** $36,391 (was projected $54,391 with $218k opening)

#### Work Structure  
- **GP hours reduced:** 30 hrs/week → 20 hrs/week (more believable R&D commitment)
- **GP income adjusted:** $375,652 → $266,800 over 24 months ($11,117/month from 20 hrs/week @ $145/hr)
- **Total work commitment:** 50 hrs/week (20 hrs GP + 30 hrs R&D) - sustainable and credible
- **Rationale:** Makes 30 hrs/week R&D commitment more believable for grant reviewers

#### Co-Funding
- **Total available:** $466,800 (shareholder funds $200k + GP income $266.8k)
- **Required:** $430,156
- **Surplus:** $36,644 ✓

#### Cashflow Management
- **Opening (business account):** $100,000
- **Lowest point:** $1,968 (Month 24, just before final grant payment)
- **Strategic management:** Never goes negative due to timed drawdowns from Ting's reserve
- **All shareholder funds utilized:** By Month 18, full $200k deployed

### Documents Updated
- ✅ `cashflow-24-month.md` - Complete recalculation with $100k opening + 4 drawdowns
- ✅ `cost-template.md` - Updated co-funding sources section
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Comprehensive financial section rewrite
- ✅ `forge-application-narrative.md` - Updated co-funding evidence

### Rationale
1. **More believable:** 50 hrs/week total work is more credible than 60 hrs/week
2. **Financial discipline:** Two-account structure demonstrates strategic planning
3. **Risk mitigation:** If grant delayed, Ting's reserve provides buffer
4. **Efficient capital deployment:** All $200k shareholder funds utilized by Month 18

## [3.1] - 2025-11-29

### Changed - Capability Development Expansion

  - Phase 2 - Ongoing PM Coaching (6 sessions): ~$2,500
  - **Focus:** Training Ting as R&D Operations Lead

#### Budget Impact
- **Total eligible costs:** $695,976 → $716,926 (+$20,950)
- **Grant (40%):** $278,305 → $286,770 (+$8,465)
- **Co-funding (60%):** $417,586 → $430,156 (+$12,570)
- **CapDev percentage:** 5.39% → 5.02% (now calculated on total costs, not grant)

#### CapDev Compliance
- **Required:** ≥5% of total eligible costs = $35,846
- **Actual:** $36,000
- **Status:** ✓ Meets requirement (confirmed by Paula, Callaghan Innovation, 29 Nov 2025)
- **Key clarification:** 5% rule applies to total costs, not grant amount

### Documents Updated
- ✅ `cost-template.md` - Added CDP-6 and CDP-5 sections
- ✅ `capability-development-evidence-pack.md` - Comprehensive update with all 4 categories
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated CapDev section
- ✅ `forge-application-narrative.md` - Updated CapDev in narrative

### Rationale
- Paula (Callaghan mentor) confirmed CapDev must be ≥5% of total eligible costs
- Original $15k (2 categories) was only 2.15% - insufficient
- Expanded to include high-value professional services that build long-term R&D capability
- CDP-5 focuses on training Ting to manage R&D (not just admin work) - demonstrates growth intention

## [3.0] - 2025-11-28

### Changed - Major Objectives Revision
**Complete refocusing from 50+ tools to 2 core use cases:**

#### Objectives Restructured
- **Previous:** Broad AI assistant with many features
- **New:** Focused on 2 core tools over 24 months
  1. **Inbox Helper:** Triage, classify, auto-file inbox items (labs, letters, referrals, patient messages)
  2. **Care Gap Finder:** Scan patient records for overdue chronic disease checks (diabetes, CVD, COPD, CHF, asthma)

#### Key Features Added
- **Dual PMS integration:** Both Medtech AND Indici supported from Objective 1 onwards
- **Lean MVP approach:** Early releases to paid adopters as safety thresholds are met
- **Architecture validation R&D:** Test which AI approach works best for each risk level (simple classifiers vs hybrid rules+LLM vs NZ-trained LLM)
- **Multi-PMS generalisation R&D:** Research how to maintain performance across different PMSs, practices, populations

#### Long-Term Vision (Years 3-5)
- **HealthHub NZ:** Patient-facing web app reusing validated NZ-LLM and safety frameworks
- **Advanced R&D streams:** Multimodal models, continual learning, te reo Māori support, equity-focused algorithms, real-world outcome trials
- **Broader ecosystem:** National FHIR API integration, plug-in architecture for more PMSs

#### High-Risk Features Removed
- Prescription validation (too complex for 24-month scope)
- High-complexity clinical decision support
- Features beyond inbox management and care gap monitoring

### Documents Updated
- ✅ `revised-objectives-24-months.md` - Complete rewrite of all 4 objectives
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated R&D objectives section
- ✅ `forge-application-narrative.md` - Updated objectives narrative

### Rationale
- Focused scope reduces risk and increases likelihood of success
- 2 core tools easier to validate and release early
- Still substantial R&D (architecture validation, multi-PMS generalisation, NZ-LLM training)
- Clear path to Years 3-5 expansion shows long-term R&D performer vision

## [2.0] - 2025-11-26

### Changed - Team Structure & Budget Finalization
**Reduced from 4-person to 3-person team:**

#### Team Structure
- **Founder:** 30 hrs/week (was 25 hrs/week), 3,120 hours @ $96/hr = $299,520
- **Ting (R&D Operations Lead):** 40 hrs/week full-time (new role), 4,152 hours @ $70/hr = $290,640
- **Developer:** 10-40 hrs/week flexible (starts Month 4), minimum 903 hours @ $72/hr = $65,016
- **Removed:** Developer 2 (simplified team structure)

#### Budget Changes
- **Total eligible costs:** $733,416 → $695,976 (-$37,440)
- **Labour:** $693,176 (Founder + Ting + Developer minimum hours)
- **CapDev:** $15,000 (2 categories: IP $7.5k + Regulatory $7.5k)
- **M&C:** $24,000 ($1,000/month recurring cloud costs)
- **Hardware:** $1,800 (RAM, monitor, arms, iPhone SE - immediate expenses only)

#### Hardware Strategy
- **GPU workstation ($11k) deferred** - using cloud GPU instead
- **Rationale:** Cloud GPU provides 40% grant coverage vs 26.7% for workstation depreciation
- **M&C includes:** Cloud GPU $300/month + dev tools $320/month + other cloud $380/month

#### Cashflow
- **Opening cash:** $100,000
- **GP income:** $375,652 over 24 months ($15,652/month average from 30 hrs/week @ $145/hr)
- **Status:** Positive throughout (but tight in months 21-24, may need to increase opening to $110k)
- **Final position:** $39,185 surplus

### Documents Updated
- ✅ `cost-template.md` - Updated team structure and costs
- ✅ `cashflow-24-month.md` - Recalculated with 3-person team
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated team and financial sections

### Rationale
- Leaner 3-person team more focused and cost-effective
- Ting full-time as R&D Operations Lead demonstrates "growth intention" (Paula's feedback)
- Developer flexible hours (10-40 hrs/week) allows scaling based on R&D workload
- Cloud-first strategy provides better grant coverage and operational flexibility
