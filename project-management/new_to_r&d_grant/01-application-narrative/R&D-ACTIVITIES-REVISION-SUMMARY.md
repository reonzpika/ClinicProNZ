## Section-by-Section Transformation

### ✅ Q1: Describe R&D Activities (250 words)

**BEFORE:** Product-focused, jargon-heavy  
**AFTER:** Research methodology with clinical testbeds

**Key Improvements:**
- Opens with "Research Objective" not "The Problem"
- Emphasizes "systematic investigation" and "experimentally compare"
- Tools framed as "clinical test beds for experimentation"
- Clearly states research questions for each use case
- Mentions knowledge transferability to Years 3-5
- All jargon explained (LLM = Large Language Models)

**Tone:** Rigorous scientific investigation

---

### ✅ Q2: Uncertainty (250 words)

**BEFORE:** Scattered list of 6 separate problems  
**AFTER:** Structured primary + 5 cascading uncertainties

**Key Improvements:**
- **Primary uncertainty** clearly stated upfront
- Five sub-uncertainties shown as interconnected
- Each uncertainty includes "why unknowable without testing"
- Emphasizes "unprecedented combination"
- Links to future R&D (patient-facing AI)
- Medical terms explained (cardiovascular disease not CVD)

**Tone:** Sophisticated research problem framing

---

### ✅ Q3: R&D Challenge (250 words)

**BEFORE:** General reasons why it's hard  
**AFTER:** Specific reasons professionals can't deduce answers

**Key Improvements:**
- Emphasis on "even highly competent ML professionals"
- **Emergent complexity** and **interaction effects** highlighted
- "Cannot be deduced" and "unknowable without experimentation" repeated
- Shows why expertise isn't enough—systematic testing required
- Explains unprecedented constraint combination
- Stronger evidence of R&D necessity

**Tone:** Convincing case for why this needs R&D funding

---

### ✅ Q4: Knowledge Availability (250 words)

**BEFORE:** Sounded defensive ("others didn't publish")  
**AFTER:** Structural reasons why knowledge can't exist yet

**Key Improvements:**
- Comprehensive survey of what exists (overseas tools, generic LLMs, academic research, proprietary solutions)
- Clear explanation of **why each is insufficient** (not adapted, too expensive, no benchmarks, trade secrets)
- "Individual components exist, integrated system does not"
- Emphasis on **unprecedented combination** of constraints
- Shows thorough research of existing work
- No defensive tone—factual explanation of knowledge gap

**Tone:** Authoritative knowledge of the field

---

### ✅ Q5: Newness - THE CRITICAL ONE ⭐ (250 words)

**BEFORE:** List of product features  
**AFTER:** Six domains of new knowledge with transferability

**Key Improvements:**
- **Reframed entirely as research contributions**
- Each knowledge domain includes:
  - What new knowledge is generated
  - Application (how it's used)
  - Transferability (where else it applies)
- "Research outputs embodied in two clinical tools" (tools are testbeds, not the innovation)
- Strong connection to Years 3-5 vision
- "Foundational platform" framing
- Shows knowledge is reusable sector-wide

**Tone:** World-class research with broad applicability

---

### ✅ Q6: Why Better (250 words)

**BEFORE:** Sales pitch (time savings, cost reduction)  
**AFTER:** Research enables capabilities previously impossible

**Key Improvements:**
- **Research contributions → new capabilities** framework
- Sovereignty + cost framing as research outcome
- Strategic value to NZ health sector emphasized
- "Without this research..." statements show criticality
- Knowledge platform enables future innovations
- Aligns with government priorities (Te Whatu Ora, health equity, sovereignty)
- Still includes practical benefits but framed as research impact

**Tone:** Strategic national importance + research rigor
