## Strategic Context

**The Race:** AI tools for healthcare are proliferating. Speed to market matters, but building the RIGHT thing matters more.

**Why Partnerships Matter:**
- ✅ **Build the right thing faster** - Real feedback beats assumptions
- ✅ **Reduce iteration cycles** - Weeks instead of months
- ✅ **Faster pilot recruitment** - Pre-identified practices ready to test
- ✅ **Market intelligence** - Learn from others' failures
- ✅ **Distribution channels** - Scale fast post-MVP
- ✅ **Credibility** - Social proof shortens sales cycles

**What Partnerships Can't Do:** Make you code faster or add more features  
**What Partnerships Can Do:** Help you prioritise correctly and validate quickly

**Contact:**
- Colleen Hardiman (chardiman@comprehensivecare.co.nz)
- Role: [To be confirmed at meeting]

### Meeting: Thursday, December 5, 2025

**Context:** They only know about ClinicPro SaaS. They don't know about:
- Medtech integration (images widget)
- R&D grant project ($700k, 24 months, Inbox Helper + Care Gap Finder)

### Primary Objectives

**1. Establish Fast Feedback Loop**
- Get 2-3 GPs from their network for regular prototype reviews
- Cadence: Every 2-4 weeks, 30-minute Zoom sessions
- Purpose: Validate Inbox Helper + Care Gap Finder assumptions

**2. Identify Pilot Practices (For Month 10+)**
- 3-5 practices interested in early testing
- Not a commitment now, just expressions of interest
- Saves 2-3 months of recruitment time when ready

**3. Gather Market Intelligence**
- Survey findings: What are practices asking for?
- Pain points: Inbox workload? Which care gaps?
- Competitive landscape: What tools are practices using/abandoning?

**4. Define Success Metrics**
- What PHO quality metrics do they track?
- Current baseline for care gap completion rates
- What would "good" look like if tool actually worked?

### Secondary Objectives

**5. Understand Workflow Reality**
- Who handles inbox triage? (Admin, nurses, GPs?)
- Daily workflow patterns
- Current tools and processes

**6. Explore Distribution Access**
- If pilots succeed, access to practice managers network
- Regular meetings where we could present to practices
- Introduction pathway to other practices

**7. Social Proof / Credibility**
- Quote for website when we launch
- Case study if pilots succeed
- Reference customer potential

### What We're NOT Doing

❌ **No investment ask** - Project already funded  
❌ **No hard sell of ClinicPro** - Focus on R&D partnership  
❌ **No technical deep-dives** - Keep it strategic (outcomes, efficiency, quality)  
❌ **No over-commitment** - Partnerships, not binding contracts

## Risk Management

### Partnership Risks

**Risk: Partner Dependency**
- Mitigation: Multiple PHO partners, not just one
- Mitigation: Don't over-customise for one partner

**Risk: Conflicting Priorities**
- Mitigation: Clear objectives set upfront
- Mitigation: Regular alignment check-ins

**Risk: Slow Partner Response**
- Mitigation: Define response time expectations
- Mitigation: Multiple feedback sources (not dependent on one)

**Risk: Partner Wants Too Much Influence**
- Mitigation: Partnership ≠ investment (no equity, no board seat)
- Mitigation: Clear boundaries on decision-making

**Risk: Market Limitation**
- Mitigation: Non-exclusive partnerships only
- Mitigation: Work with multiple PHOs simultaneously

## Notes & Learnings

### Key Insights

**From Paula (Mentor - Nov 13, 2025):**
- Grant proposal already strong
- No further letters of support needed
- Focus on execution, not more validation

**From Strategic Planning (Nov 29, 2025):**
- Don't take investment from PHOs - keep them as customers/partners
- Partnerships should accelerate building the RIGHT thing, not just building faster
- Multiple PHO relationships > exclusive partnership with one
- Partnership ≠ investment (no equity dilution, maintain control)

### Comprehensive Care Context

**What they know:** ClinicPro AI scribe (SaaS product)

**What they don't know:**
- Medtech integration (images widget, almost complete)
- R&D grant project ($700k, 24 months, Inbox Helper + Care Gap Finder)

**Their situation:**
- Actively surveying AI/scribing tools (sent survey 31 Oct, deadline 21 Nov)
- In evaluation/buying mode for AI solutions
- Focus on practice support and quality outcomes

**Strategic opportunity:**
- Perfect timing (they're looking for solutions)
- Perfect fit (we're building what they need)
- Perfect scale (400 GPs = significant validation + distribution potential)
