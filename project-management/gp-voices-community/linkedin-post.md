# GP Voices Community - LinkedIn Post

## Post Content

**Hook**: Calling all New Zealand GPs — we've built something for you.

**Body**:

After months of listening to GPs talk about the challenges of staying connected and sharing knowledge, we've launched **GP Voices** — a community platform designed specifically for New Zealand general practitioners.

What makes GP Voices different?

💬 **Comment-first design**: Jump straight into discussions without navigating complex forum structures. Share your thoughts quickly, whether you're between patients or at home.

🤖 **AI-powered weekly summaries**: Get curated insights from the community without spending hours scrolling. Our AI pulls together the most valuable discussions and clinical insights each week.

📱 **Built for mobile**: We know you're on your phone between consultations. GP Voices is optimised for mobile workflows — sticky navigation, quick replies, and a clean interface that works on the go.

🏷️ **Organised by what matters**: Content tagged by clinical areas (AI scribe, inbox management, general practice) so you can find what you need fast.

**Why we built this**: General practice can feel isolating. You're making critical decisions every day, but opportunities to connect with colleagues, share best practices, and learn from each other are limited. GP Voices changes that.

**Call to action**:

Whether you're using ClinicPro or just want to connect with other NZ GPs, you're welcome here. Let's build a community that makes general practice better for everyone.

### Variation 3: Feature-Focused (Technical Audience)

**Hook**: We rebuilt community forums for how GPs actually work.

**Body**:

Traditional forums don't work for busy GPs. Too much navigation. Too much scrolling. Too much friction.

**GP Voices** is different — built from the ground up for New Zealand general practitioners.

**Key features**:

💬 **Comment-first UX**: Featured discussions front and centre. New posts de-emphasised. Get straight to the conversation.

🤖 **AI weekly summaries**: Anonymous users see bullet points; logged-in members get full AI-curated insights from community discussions.

📱 **Mobile-first**: Sticky navigation, optimised for 3G connections, touch-friendly — designed for between-patient workflows.

🏷️ **Tag-based organisation**: Content tagged by clinical areas (AI scribe, inbox management, general practice). Filter fast, find what matters.

**Technical details**: Built on Discourse with custom theme components. Clerk OIDC authentication. Deployed at clinicpro.co.nz/gp-voices
