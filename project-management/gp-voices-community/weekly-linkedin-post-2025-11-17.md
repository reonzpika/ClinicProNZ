## Standalone Posts (Between Weekly Roundups)

### Standalone Post 1: AI Scribe Rollout & Practice Policies

**Article**: Item 1 - NZ govt rolls out AI scribe tool to doctors, despite concerns  
**Post Type**: Breaking news / Policy discussion  
**Target Post Date**: [Choose date - space out from weekly roundup]  
**Status**: ✅ Article accessible (not paywalled)

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

```
The NZ government is rolling out AI scribe tools to doctors—but are practices ready?

This week's news: AI medical scribes are being deployed across NZ healthcare, despite some concerns about implementation and oversight.

Here's what this means for GP practices: As AI tools become standard, practices need clear policies on:
• When and how AI-generated notes are used
• Clinical oversight and review processes  
• Data privacy and patient consent
• Staff training and competency

The rollout is happening—but many practices are still figuring out the governance side.

**If your practice is using (or considering) AI scribe tools, what policies have you put in place?** How are you handling clinical oversight and data privacy? Share your experience in the comments 👇

- Monitor for GP comments about their AI policies and implementation
- Engage with commenters asking follow-up questions about practice policies

### Alternative: AI Policy Discussion (No Paywall Article)

**Note**: The Pharmacy Today AI policy article is behind a paywall. If you want to discuss AI policies without linking to a paywalled article, use this version:

**LinkedIn Post Draft (No Article Link)**:

```
Do you have an AI policy in your practice?

As AI tools become standard in NZ general practice—from scribing to inbox management—many practices are using them without clear governance frameworks.

Why this matters: AI tools require policies covering:
• Acceptable use cases and limitations
• Data privacy and security protocols
• Clinical oversight and review requirements
• Staff training and competency standards
• Regular policy review as AI evolves

Without clear policies, practices risk compliance issues, data breaches, and clinical safety concerns.

**Do you have an AI policy? What's included in yours?** Share your experience or questions in the comments 👇

**Posting Notes**:
- No article link needed - discussion-driven post
- Focus on getting GPs to share their policies
- Can reference the concept without linking to paywalled content

### Standalone Post 2: Official AI Guidance for NZ GPs

**Articles**: Three official guidance documents on AI in general practice  
**Post Type**: Policy summary / Guidance  
**Target Post Date**: [Choose date - space out from other posts]  
**Status**: ✅ Official guidance documents (accessible)

**Sources**:

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

```
Clear guidance on AI in general practice is finally here—and it's coming from multiple authoritative sources.

Three major NZ healthcare organisations have released guidance on using AI in GP settings:

**Medical Council of New Zealand** (policy draft):
• Mandatory informed consent when AI affects patient care decisions
• Robust legislative and policy frameworks required
• Protections for patient privacy and data security
• Equitable outcomes for all populations (including specific Māori considerations)
• GPs must understand AI limitations to ensure clinical safety

**Pinnacle Practices** (April 2025 guidance):
Four practical principles: Consent, Check, Privacy, Secure
• Consent: Explicitly inform patients, adapt language to local needs
• Check: Carefully review all AI outputs for accuracy
• Privacy: Never upload identifiable patient data without consent
• Secure: Ensure all platforms comply with data protection standards

**Te Whatu Ora / NAIAEAG** (national guidance):
• Generative AI/LLMs should NOT be used for clinical decision-making without explicit approval
• Register applications and consult NAIAEAG before implementation
• Rigorous validation for privacy and safety required
• Regulatory compliance and organisational review mandatory

**The common themes?** Patient safety, rigorous consent, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. Caution and oversight are essential.

**Is your practice following these guidelines?** What's working—or what challenges are you facing—as you implement AI tools? Share your experience in the comments 👇
