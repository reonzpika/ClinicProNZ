**Article**: Item 1 - NZ govt rolls out AI scribe tool to doctors, despite concerns  
**Post Type**: Breaking news / Policy discussion  
**Target Post Date**: [Choose date - space out from weekly roundup]  
**Status**: ✅ Article accessible (not paywalled)

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

```
The NZ government is rolling out AI scribe tools to doctors—but are practices ready?

This week's news: AI medical scribes are being deployed across NZ healthcare, despite some concerns about implementation and oversight.

Here's what this means for GP practices: As AI tools become standard, practices need clear policies on:
• When and how AI-generated notes are used
• Clinical oversight and review processes  
• Data privacy and patient consent
• Staff training and competency

The rollout is happening—but many practices are still figuring out the governance side.

**If your practice is using (or considering) AI scribe tools, what policies have you put in place?** How are you handling clinical oversight and data privacy? Share your experience in the comments 👇

**Posting Notes**:
- Post on different day from weekly roundup (e.g., if roundup is Tuesday, post this Thursday)
- Frame as policy/governance discussion (connects to AI policy topic)
- Monitor for GP comments about their AI policies and implementation
- Engage with commenters asking follow-up questions about practice policies
- Track if this generates more GP engagement vs vendor engagement

### Alternative: AI Policy Discussion (No Paywall Article)

**Note**: The Pharmacy Today AI policy article is behind a paywall. If you want to discuss AI policies without linking to a paywalled article, use this version:

**LinkedIn Post Draft (No Article Link)**:

```
Do you have an AI policy in your practice?

As AI tools become standard in NZ general practice—from scribing to inbox management—many practices are using them without clear governance frameworks.

Why this matters: AI tools require policies covering:
• Acceptable use cases and limitations
• Data privacy and security protocols
• Clinical oversight and review requirements
• Staff training and competency standards
• Regular policy review as AI evolves

Without clear policies, practices risk compliance issues, data breaches, and clinical safety concerns.

**Do you have an AI policy? What's included in yours?** Share your experience or questions in the comments 👇

**Posting Notes**:
- No article link needed - discussion-driven post
- Focus on getting GPs to share their policies
- Can reference the concept without linking to paywalled content
