**Post Type**: Deep dive / Opinion  
**Target Post Date**: [Choose date - space out from weekly roundup]

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

Do you have an AI policy in your practice?

As more GPs adopt AI tools for scribing, inbox management, and clinical decision support, Health IT expert Sanjeewa Samaraweera makes a compelling case: implementing an AI policy isn't optional—it's essential protection.

Why this matters: AI tools are becoming standard in NZ general practice, but many practices are using them without clear guidelines on data privacy, clinical oversight, or staff training. An AI policy protects your practice, your patients, and your team.

Key points from the article:
• Define acceptable AI use cases in your practice
• Establish data privacy and security protocols
• Set clear clinical oversight requirements
• Regular policy review as AI evolves
