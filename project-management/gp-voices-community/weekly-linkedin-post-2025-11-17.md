## Curated News Items

### Item 1: Reseller News ✅ INCLUDED (MAIN FOCUS)
**Headline**: NZ govt rolls out AI scribe tool to doctors, despite concerns

**Summary**: The New Zealand government is rolling out an AI scribe tool to 1,000 doctors and frontline staff in emergency departments nationwide. Health Minister Simeon Brown says this initiative aims to reduce time spent on paperwork, enabling clinicians to focus on patient care. The AI scribe securely records consultations and generates draft clinical notes, referrals, and follow-up summaries tailored to NZ's clinical language and systems, meeting privacy standards with strong security protections. Positive results from pilots in Hawke's Bay and Whanganui led to the nationwide rollout. The technology has already been used in some primary care settings, with most healthcare providers reporting it is helpful and saves significant time (30 minutes to 2 hours per day for many users). However, some users found the editing and correction of AI-generated notes time-consuming and expressed concerns about note accuracy, completeness, and conciseness. Criticisms include deployment while regulations and guidelines are still evolving, data privacy/security risks—especially with international cloud storage—and Māori data sovereignty concerns. Only 66% of surveyed providers read the software's terms and conditions, and just 59% sought patient consent.

🌍 **Clinical decision support increases GP confidence in managing cognitive impairment** 
Study in 38 primary care clinics found CDS tools increased confidence in managing cognitive impairment care. 97% of users said it helped provide better care. Are CDS tools making a difference in your practice?

🌍 **CDS tool may improve ACEI/ARB prescribing in chronic kidney disease** 
Despite being available for over three decades, ACEI and ARB use in CKD is still underutilized. A new clinical decision support tool aims to address this gap. What barriers are you seeing to optimal prescribing?

🇳🇿 **Medtech ALEX webinars now available on demand** 
Medtech Global has released a series of webinars featuring their ALEX API Integration Partners, covering innovations like clinical documentation, SR Referrals integration, and mobile access. Useful for GPs using Medtech systems.

🇳🇿 **Official AI guidance for NZ GPs released** 
Three organisations have released guidance:
  ✅ **Medical Council of New Zealand**: Mandatory informed consent when AI affects patient care, robust frameworks, privacy protections, equitable outcomes (including Māori considerations)
  ✅ **Pinnacle Practices**: Four principles — Consent, Check, Privacy, Secure — with practical recommendations
  ✅ **Te Whatu Ora / NAIAEAG**: Generative AI/LLMs should NOT be used for clinical decision-making without explicit approval

💡 **The big picture**: The AI scribe rollout is happening now — 1,000 doctors are getting access. While it saves time for many, concerns about accuracy, consent, and data sovereignty need addressing. International research shows CDS tools can help, while NZ-specific guidance provides the framework for safe implementation. The key? Clear policies, clinical oversight, and protecting both patient safety and the human element of care.

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

```
The NZ government is rolling out AI scribe tools to doctors—but are practices ready?

This week's news: AI medical scribes are being deployed across NZ healthcare, despite some concerns about implementation and oversight.

Here's what this means for GP practices: As AI tools become standard, practices need clear policies on:
• When and how AI-generated notes are used
• Clinical oversight and review processes  
• Data privacy and patient consent
• Staff training and competency

The rollout is happening—but many practices are still figuring out the governance side.

**If your practice is using (or considering) AI scribe tools, what policies have you put in place?** How are you handling clinical oversight and data privacy? Share your experience in the comments 👇

**LinkedIn Post Draft (No Article Link)**:

```
Do you have an AI policy in your practice?

As AI tools become standard in NZ general practice—from scribing to inbox management—many practices are using them without clear governance frameworks.

Why this matters: AI tools require policies covering:
• Acceptable use cases and limitations
• Data privacy and security protocols
• Clinical oversight and review requirements
• Staff training and competency standards
• Regular policy review as AI evolves

Without clear policies, practices risk compliance issues, data breaches, and clinical safety concerns.

**LinkedIn Post Draft**:

```
Clear guidance on AI in general practice is finally here—and it's coming from multiple authoritative sources.

Three major NZ healthcare organisations have released guidance on using AI in GP settings:

**Medical Council of New Zealand** (policy draft):
• Mandatory informed consent when AI affects patient care decisions
• Robust legislative and policy frameworks required
• Protections for patient privacy and data security
• Equitable outcomes for all populations (including specific Māori considerations)
• GPs must understand AI limitations to ensure clinical safety

**Pinnacle Practices** (April 2025 guidance):
Four practical principles: Consent, Check, Privacy, Secure
• Consent: Explicitly inform patients, adapt language to local needs
• Check: Carefully review all AI outputs for accuracy
• Privacy: Never upload identifiable patient data without consent
• Secure: Ensure all platforms comply with data protection standards

**Te Whatu Ora / NAIAEAG** (national guidance):
• Generative AI/LLMs should NOT be used for clinical decision-making without explicit approval
• Register applications and consult NAIAEAG before implementation
• Rigorous validation for privacy and safety required
• Regulatory compliance and organisational review mandatory

**The common themes?** Patient safety, rigorous consent, privacy protection, and regulatory compliance. Caution and oversight are essential.
