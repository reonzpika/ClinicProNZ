### 3. Create Image (Nano Banana)

**Title**: "This Week in NZ General Practice: AI Edition" (or adapt based on theme)

**Prompt**:
```
Create a professional LinkedIn post image (1200x1200px square format) with bold text overlay.

Design specifications:
- Background: Deep blue gradient (#1e3a8a to #0ea5e9) with subtle geometric patterns suggesting AI/technology
- Style: Modern, clean, professional healthcare aesthetic
- Colors: Blue/cyan theme (trustworthy, medical) with white text for maximum contrast

Text overlay (centered, large, bold):
"This Week in NZ General Practice: AI Edition"

Subtitle (smaller, below main title):
"[X] Updates Every GP Should Know"

Visual elements:
- Subtle circuit/neural network patterns in background (very light, not distracting)
- Small New Zealand fern or koru pattern integrated subtly
- Clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- Text with subtle shadow or outline for readability

Style: Eye-catching but professional. Suitable for healthcare professionals on LinkedIn. 
High contrast between text and background. Modern, trustworthy aesthetic.
