- NZ Doctor: https://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/
- Pharmac: https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/news/

**Selection Criteria**:
- ✅ Relevant to NZ GPs (not international-only)

### 2. Create Post Content

**Post Template**:

```

• **[Item 2 Headline]** - [Brief 1 sentence summary - what happened and why it matters]

• **[Item 3 Headline]** - [Brief 1 sentence summary - what happened and why it matters]

[Add more items as needed]

---

**The big picture**: [1-2 sentences: Common theme or takeaway across these items]

**Are you using [relevant topic] in your practice?** What's working — or not working — for you? Share your experience in the comments 👇

### 3. Create Image (Nano Banana)

**Title**: "This Week in NZ General Practice: AI Edition" (or adapt based on theme)

**Prompt**:
```
Create a professional LinkedIn post image (1200x1200px square format) with bold text overlay.

Design specifications:
- Background: Deep blue gradient (#1e3a8a to #0ea5e9) with subtle geometric patterns suggesting AI/technology
- Style: Modern, clean, professional healthcare aesthetic
- Colors: Blue/cyan theme (trustworthy, medical) with white text for maximum contrast

Text overlay (centered, large, bold):
"This Week in NZ General Practice: AI Edition"

Subtitle (smaller, below main title):
"[X] Updates Every GP Should Know"

Visual elements:
- Subtle circuit/neural network patterns in background (very light, not distracting)
- Small New Zealand fern or koru pattern integrated subtly
- Clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- Text with subtle shadow or outline for readability

Style: Eye-catching but professional. Suitable for healthcare professionals on LinkedIn. 
High contrast between text and background. Modern, trustworthy aesthetic.
```

### 4. Post & Engage

**Posting Time**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm NZST

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to first 3-5 comments within 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share additional insights
- Tag relevant people when appropriate

**Metrics to Track**:
- Post impressions
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / impressions)
- Profile views
- Link clicks
- New connections/followers

---

## @ Mentions

Use 2-4 mentions per post. Tag when content directly relates to them.

**Common Mentions**:
- @Medtech Global (PMS/digital health)
- @Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora (national health policy)
- @Health Informatics New Zealand (HiNZ) (digital health/informatics)
- @RNZCGP (GP standards/training)
- @General Practice New Zealand (GPNZ) (primary care policy)
- @HealthTech Activator (HTA) (healthtech innovation)
- @New Zealand Doctor / Rata Aotearoa (medical media)
- @HealthPathways (clinical pathways)
- @The Royal New Zealand College of Urgent Care (RNZCUC) (urgent care)
- @Collaborative Aotearoa (health collaboration)
- @GenPro (practice ownership/business)

**Usage Guidelines**:
- Only tag when content directly relates to them
- Don't over-tag (can look spammy)
- Tag in context (e.g., "As @Medtech Global integrates AI features...")

## # Hashtags

Use 5-8 hashtags per post. Mix evergreen + trending + NZ-specific.

**Recommended Mix** (pick 2-3 from each):

**Evergreen**: #PrimaryCare #GeneralPractice #NZHealth #Healthcare

**Trending**: #AIinHealth #DigitalHealth #HealthTech #HealthInnovation #MedTech

**NZ-specific**: #AotearoaHealth #GPsNZ #HealthTechNZ #PrimaryCareNZ #DigitalHealthNZ

**Full List**:

**General/Evergreen**: #PrimaryCare #GeneralPractice #Healthcare #HealthEquity #PatientCentredCare #HealthInnovation #DigitalHealth #HealthTech #HealthInformatics #MedTech #HealthPolicy #ClinicalExcellence #CareIntegration #HealthSystems

**NZ/Local**: #AotearoaHealth #NZHealth #TeWhatuOra #HealthNZ #GPsNZ #PrimaryCareNZ #HealthTechNZ #DigitalHealthNZ #InnovationNZ #HealthEquityNZ #KiwiHealth

**Trending/Topical**: #AIinHealth #Telehealth #DataAnalytics #Interoperability #HealthTransformation #InnovationEcosystem #SustainableHealthcare #FutureOfHealth #PrecisionMedicine #MedTechInnovation #StartupsInHealth

**Best Practice**: Don't repeat similar hashtags (#HealthTech and #HealthTechNZ are redundant - pick one). Place hashtags at the end of the post.
