# LinkedIn Weekly Content Strategy & Workflow

**Status**: Active Validation (Week 1/6 complete)  
**Goal**: Test if GPs want curated NZ healthcare news before building automation  
**Strategy**: Manual curation → Validate demand → Automate only if proven

---

## Validation Criteria

**Success = GP/Practice Manager Engagement**
- ✅ GPs commenting on posts
- ✅ Practice managers saving/sharing content
- ✅ Target audience following for weekly updates
- ✅ Questions/requests for more frequent/detailed summaries

**Vanity Metrics (Don't Count)**
- ❌ AI tool vendor engagement (not target audience)
- ❌ Total reactions without audience context
- ❌ Impressions without conversion

**Decision Timeline**: 4-6 weeks of weekly posts

**Threshold for "Demand Proven"**:
- At least 3-5 GP/practice manager comments per post (on average)
- At least 10 new GP followers (not vendors) over 4-6 weeks
- At least 2-3 saves per post (indicates reference value)
- Requests for more frequent updates or specific topics

**Target Metrics** (After 4 weeks):
- 100+ impressions per post
- 5%+ engagement rate
- 10+ comments per post
- 20+ link clicks
- 5+ new community members

**If Validation Succeeds**:
- Build automated news curation workflow
- Sources: BPAC, NZ Doctor, Pharmac, HQSC, Ministry of Health, RNZCGP, etc.
- Automated extraction, summarisation, and draft generation
- Human review before posting (keep editorial control)

**If Validation Fails**:
- Stop weekly posts after 6 weeks
- Pivot to different content strategy or abandon LinkedIn approach

## Weekly Workflow Steps

### 1. Curate News (15-20 min)

- Ministry of Health: https://www.health.govt.nz/
- Medical Council: https://www.mcnz.org.nz/
- RNZCGP: https://www.rnzcgp.org.nz/
- HINZ: https://www.hinz.org.nz/
- LinkedIn (healthtech companies)

**News Gathering Method**:
- **Google Alerts** (Weekly digests) - Set up 2025-11-10
  
  **NZ-Focused Alerts (5 alerts)**:
  - Primary keywords: AI, healthtech, artificial intelligence, IT
  - Secondary keywords: GP, general practice, hospital, primary care, Medtech, Indici

  **International GP AI Alerts (5 alerts)**:
  - Topics: AI GP innovation, AI clinical tools (US/UK/AU), AI adoption studies, AI GP use cases, healthtech funding
  - Region: Global (any region)
  
  **Settings**: Weekly email digests, "Only the best results" to reduce noise

**Selection Criteria**:

**✅ Include Articles When**:
- Relevant to NZ GPs (not international-only, or international with NZ applicability)
- Actionable or thought-provoking
- Recent (within last 7 days for weekly roundups)
- Clinical or practice management focused
- Not vendor-focused (avoiding consultancies, tech companies promoting products)
- Not investment/finance focused (unless directly GP practice-relevant)
- Not paywalled (readers must be able to access)

**❌ Exclude Articles When**:
- Pure politics, controversial topics without clinical angle
- Vendor-focused content (consultancies, tech companies promoting products)
- Investment/finance focused (not GP practice-relevant)
- Paywalled (readers can't access)
- Can't access article (request blocked)

**⚠️ Borderline - Evaluate Case by Case**:
- Important topics but not directly GP practice-relevant
- Use as filler content only if needed for 4th-5th item

**Select 3-5 items** for the weekly roundup.

### 2. Create Post Content

**Post Template**:

```
[Hook - 1 sentence that grabs attention]

📰 **This Week in NZ General Practice**

• **[Item 1 Headline]** - [Brief 1 sentence summary - what happened and why it matters]

• **[Item 2 Headline]** - [Brief 1 sentence summary - what happened and why it matters]

• **[Item 3 Headline]** - [Brief 1 sentence summary - what happened and why it matters]

[Add more items as needed]

---

**The big picture**: [1-2 sentences: Common theme or takeaway across these items]

**Are you using [relevant topic] in your practice?** What's working — or not working — for you? Share your experience in the comments 👇

**References:**
1. [Item 1 description]: [URL]
2. [Item 2 description]: [URL]

```

**Content Guidelines**:
- Mark articles as [NZ] or [International] for clarity
- Focus on GP practice relevance
- Ask engagement questions that GPs (not vendors) can answer
- Include stronger link CTAs to drive clicks
- Use emojis strategically for visual appeal

---

### 3. Create Image (Nano Banana)

**Title**: "This Week in NZ General Practice: [Theme] Edition" (adapt based on theme)

**Prompt**:
```
Create a professional LinkedIn post image (1200x1200px square format) with bold text overlay.

Design specifications:
- Background: Deep blue gradient (#1e3a8a to #0ea5e9) with subtle geometric patterns suggesting AI/technology
- Style: Modern, clean, professional healthcare aesthetic
- Colors: Blue/cyan theme (trustworthy, medical) with white text for maximum contrast

Text overlay (centered, large, bold):
"This Week in NZ General Practice: [Theme] Edition"

Subtitle (smaller, below main title):
"[X] Updates Every GP Should Know"

Visual elements:
- Subtle circuit/neural network patterns in background (very light, not distracting)
- Small New Zealand fern or koru pattern integrated subtly
- Clean, modern sans-serif font (Inter, Poppins, or similar)
- Text with subtle shadow or outline for readability

Style: Eye-catching but professional. Suitable for healthcare professionals on LinkedIn. 
High contrast between text and background. Modern, trustworthy aesthetic.
```

### 4. Post & Engage

**Posting Time**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm NZST

**Engagement Strategy**:
- Respond to first 3-5 comments within 2 hours
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share additional insights
- Tag relevant people when appropriate
- Check profiles of new followers (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Check profiles of commenters (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Track audience quality, not just quantity

**Metrics to Track**:
- Post impressions
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / impressions)
- Profile views
- Link clicks
- New connections/followers
- Saves (indicates reference value)
- **Audience quality**: GP vs vendor engagement ratio

---

## @ Mentions

Use 2-4 mentions per post. Tag when content directly relates to them.

**Common Mentions**:
- @Medtech Global (PMS/digital health)
- @Health New Zealand - Te Whatu Ora (national health policy)
- @Health Informatics New Zealand (HiNZ) (digital health/informatics)

- Don't over-tag (can look spammy)
- Tag in context (e.g., "As @Medtech Global integrates AI features...")

---

## # Hashtags

Use 5-8 hashtags per post. Mix evergreen + trending + NZ-specific.

**Recommended Mix** (pick 2-3 from each):

**Evergreen**: #PrimaryCare #GeneralPractice #NZHealth #Healthcare

**Trending**: #AIinHealth #DigitalHealth #HealthTech #HealthInnovation #MedTech

**NZ-specific**: #AotearoaHealth #GPsNZ #HealthTechNZ #PrimaryCareNZ #DigitalHealthNZ

**Full List**:

**General/Evergreen**: #PrimaryCare #GeneralPractice #Healthcare #HealthEquity #PatientCentredCare #HealthInnovation #DigitalHealth #HealthTech #HealthInformatics #MedTech #HealthPolicy #ClinicalExcellence #CareIntegration #HealthSystems

**NZ/Local**: #AotearoaHealth #NZHealth #TeWhatuOra #HealthNZ #GPsNZ #PrimaryCareNZ #HealthTechNZ #DigitalHealthNZ #InnovationNZ #HealthEquityNZ #KiwiHealth

**Trending/Topical**: #AIinHealth #Telehealth #DataAnalytics #Interoperability #HealthTransformation #InnovationEcosystem #SustainableHealthcare #FutureOfHealth #PrecisionMedicine #MedTechInnovation #StartupsInHealth

**Best Practice**: Don't repeat similar hashtags (#HealthTech and #HealthTechNZ are redundant - pick one). Place hashtags at the end of the post.

## Weekly Post Performance

### Week 1: 2025-11-08

**Topic**: AI in healthcare - scribe technology and AI-enabled practice management systems  
**Items**: 4 items

**Metrics**:
- Profile viewers from this post: 3
- Followers gained from this post: **8 new followers** (initially reported as 1, corrected)
- Reactions: 3
- Comments: 8
- Saves: 2
- Link clicks: 1

**Audience Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Most reactions from AI tool vendors, not GPs/practice managers**
- This is the critical insight - engagement volume ≠ validation
- Need to track WHO is engaging, not just HOW MANY

**Learnings**:
- Vendor engagement doesn't validate demand from target audience
- Need better tracking of follower/commenter roles (GP vs vendor)
- 8 new followers is promising, but need to verify they're GPs
- 2 saves suggests content has reference value
- Low link clicks (1) - may need stronger CTA

**Action for Next Post**:
- Check profiles of new followers (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Check profiles of commenters (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Track audience quality, not just quantity

---

### Current Aggregate Status (After 1 week)

- Total posts: 1
- Total GP followers gained: 8 (need to verify GP vs vendor)
