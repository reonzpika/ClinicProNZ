**4. NZ govt rolls out AI scribe tool to doctors, despite concerns**
- **Source**: Reseller News
- **Type**: [NZ] News
- **URL**: https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/4087164/nz-govt-rolls-out-ai-scribe-tool-to-doctors-despite-concerns.html
- **Summary**: The New Zealand government is rolling out an AI scribe tool to 1,000 doctors and frontline staff in emergency departments nationwide. Health Minister Simeon Brown says this initiative aims to reduce time spent on paperwork, enabling clinicians to focus on patient care. The AI scribe securely records consultations and generates draft clinical notes, referrals, and follow-up summaries tailored to NZ's clinical language and systems, meeting privacy standards with strong security protections. Positive results from pilots in Hawke's Bay and Whanganui led to the nationwide rollout. However, some users found the editing and correction of AI-generated notes time-consuming and expressed concerns about note accuracy, completeness, and conciseness. Criticisms include deployment while regulations and guidelines are still evolving, data privacy/security risks—especially with international cloud storage—and Māori data sovereignty concerns. Only 66% of surveyed providers read the software's terms and conditions, and just 59% sought patient consent.
