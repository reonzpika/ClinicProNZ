**Audience Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Most reactions from AI tool vendors, not GPs/practice managers**
- Critical insight: engagement volume ≠ validation
- Need to track WHO is engaging, not just HOW MANY

**Notable Engagement**:

- @Terry Cornick replied: Adding companies to HTD ANZ Healthtech Directory

**Learnings**:
- Platform-agnostic messaging resonates with GPs
- Directory/resources are valuable to community
- AI tool mentions generate engagement from vendors
- Vendor engagement doesn't validate demand from target audience
- 8 new followers is promising, but need to verify they're GPs
- 2 saves suggests content has reference value
- Low link clicks (1) - may need stronger CTA

**Replies Sent**:
- Octans Care: Acknowledged platform-agnostic approach, asked GPs about digital front door vision
- Terry Cornick: Thanked for directory addition, acknowledged value to ecosystem

**4. NZ govt rolls out AI scribe tool to doctors, despite concerns**
- **Source**: Reseller News
- **Type**: [NZ] News
- **URL**: https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/4087164/nz-govt-rolls-out-ai-scribe-tool-to-doctors-despite-concerns.html
- **Summary**: The New Zealand government is rolling out an AI scribe tool to 1,000 doctors and frontline staff in emergency departments nationwide. Health Minister Simeon Brown says this initiative aims to reduce time spent on paperwork, enabling clinicians to focus on patient care. The AI scribe securely records consultations and generates draft clinical notes, referrals, and follow-up summaries tailored to NZ's clinical language and systems, meeting privacy standards with strong security protections. Positive results from pilots in Hawke's Bay and Whanganui led to the nationwide rollout. However, some users found the editing and correction of AI-generated notes time-consuming and expressed concerns about note accuracy, completeness, and conciseness. Criticisms include deployment while regulations and guidelines are still evolving, data privacy/security risks—especially with international cloud storage—and Māori data sovereignty concerns. Only 66% of surveyed providers read the software's terms and conditions, and just 59% sought patient consent.
