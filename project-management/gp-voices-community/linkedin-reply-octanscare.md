### Option 1: Question-Driven (Best for Algorithm)

```
Thanks @Octans Care! The platform-agnostic approach makes a lot of sense - GPs are using different PMS systems, so having AI tools that work across platforms removes a major barrier to adoption.

The "digital front door" vision is interesting. For GPs reading this: what would a seamless digital front door look like in your practice? What's the biggest friction point you'd want AI to solve first?

### Option 2: Value-Add + Question

```
Thanks @Octans Care! Platform-agnostic is smart - that flexibility is exactly what practices need when they're already invested in different PMS systems.

The "digital front door" concept resonates. For practices using multiple systems, seamless integration could be a game-changer. 

Question for the community: Are you seeing AI tools that work across different PMS platforms, or are most still locked to one system? What's your experience been?

### Option 3: Acknowledge + Expand Discussion

```
Thanks @Octans Care! The platform-agnostic approach is key - it removes the "which PMS do you use?" barrier that often blocks innovation adoption in general practice.

The "digital front door" vision is compelling. For GPs: What would make you more likely to adopt AI tools - seamless integration with your existing PMS, or standalone tools that work independently?

Curious to hear what's working (or not) for practices already using AI tools.

### Option 4: Short & Engaging (Best for Quick Engagement)

```
Thanks @Octans Care! Platform-agnostic is exactly what practices need - no one wants to be locked into one system.

The "digital front door" vision sounds promising. For GPs reading: What's your biggest pain point that AI could solve? Inbox management? Documentation? Something else?
