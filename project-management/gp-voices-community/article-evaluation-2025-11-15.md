**Date**: 2025-11-15  
**Target Audience**: New Zealand GPs and Practice Managers  
**Validation Goal**: GP/practice manager engagement (NOT vendor engagement)

---

## Evaluation Criteria

**✅ INCLUDE if**:
- Directly relevant to GP practice (clinical, workflow, policy)
- NZ-focused or internationally applicable to NZ GPs
- Likely to generate GP discussion/engagement
- Not vendor-focused (won't attract AI tool vendors)

**❌ EXCLUDE if**:

- Investment/finance focused (not GP practice-relevant)
- Too specialist/research-focused (not general practice)
- International-only without NZ relevance

## Article Evaluations

### 1. The Post: "Long and short of it: Investors are turning to healthcare as economic clouds gather"
**URL**: https://www.thepost.co.nz/business/360884363/long-and-short-it-investors-are-turning-healthcare-economic-clouds-gather

**Topic**: Investment trends in healthcare sector

**Evaluation**: ❌ **EXCLUDE**
- **Reason**: Investment/finance focused, not directly relevant to GP practice
- **Risk**: Won't generate GP engagement; attracts wrong audience (investors/finance)
- **GP Relevance**: Low — GPs care about practice operations, not investment trends

### 2. IT Brief: "Accenture NZ's Dr Will Reedy reveals how AI is reshaping healthcare"
**URL**: https://itbrief.co.nz/story/exclusive-accenture-nz-s-dr-will-reedy-reveals-how-ai-is-reshaping-healthcare

**Topic**: Accenture consultant discussing AI in healthcare

**Evaluation**: ❌ **EXCLUDE**
- **Reason**: **VENDOR-FOCUSED** — Accenture is a consultancy promoting AI services
- **Risk**: **HIGH** — Will attract AI tool vendors (exactly what Week 1 showed we need to avoid)
- **GP Relevance**: Medium (AI is relevant) but vendor angle makes it problematic
- **Week 1 Learning**: This type of content attracted vendors, not GPs

### 3. MedTechIQ: "Preserving our Heritage in the Light of Innovation: Pacific Data Sovereignty and AI"
**URL**: https://www.medtechiq.co.nz/news/preserving-our-heritage-in-the-light-of-innovation-pacific-data-sovereignty-and-ai

**Topic**: Pacific data sovereignty and AI intersection

**Evaluation**: ⚠️ **MAYBE** (Borderline)
- **Reason**: Important topic (data sovereignty) but not directly GP practice-relevant
- **GP Relevance**: Low-Medium — Important for NZ context but abstract for daily practice
- **Risk**: May not generate GP engagement; too policy/research focused
- **Recommendation**: **SKIP** unless you have 2-3 stronger GP-relevant articles and need filler

### 4. BMC Primary Care: "Clinical decision support increases primary care clinician confidence in managing cognitive impairment"
**URL**: https://bmcprimcare.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12875-025-03053-z

**Topic**: Clinical decision support tool for cognitive impairment in primary care

**Evaluation**: ✅ **INCLUDE** (Strong candidate)
- **Reason**: **Highly GP-relevant** — Primary care focus, clinical decision support, common GP issue
- **GP Relevance**: **HIGH** — Cognitive impairment is common in GP practice; CDS tools are directly relevant
- **Engagement Potential**: High — GPs can discuss their experience with CDS tools, cognitive screening
- **Risk**: Low — Research-focused but primary care context makes it accessible
- **NZ Relevance**: Medium-High — International research but applicable to NZ GP practice
- **Note**: Academic article but findings are practical and relevant

### 5. Yahoo News: "Founder admits AI transcription startup..."
**URL**: https://nz.news.yahoo.com/founder-admits-ai-transcription-startup-162025214.html

**Topic**: AI transcription startup (couldn't fetch full content)

**Evaluation**: ❌ **EXCLUDE** (Likely)
- **Reason**: **VENDOR-FOCUSED** — Startup founder discussing their product
- **Risk**: **HIGH** — Will attract AI tool vendors and startup founders, not GPs
- **GP Relevance**: Medium (transcription is relevant) but vendor angle problematic
- **Week 1 Learning**: Startup/vendor content attracted wrong audience
- **Note**: Couldn't verify full content, but title suggests vendor focus

### 6. Medscape: "Clinical Decision Support Tool May Improve ACEI and ARB Use in CKD"
**URL**: https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/clinical-decision-support-tool-may-improve-acei-and-arb-use-2025a1000vje

**Topic**: Clinical decision support for ACEI/ARB prescribing in chronic kidney disease

**Evaluation**: ✅ **INCLUDE** (Strong candidate)
- **Reason**: **Highly GP-relevant** — CKD management is common in GP practice; CDS tools directly relevant
- **GP Relevance**: **HIGH** — ACEI/ARB prescribing is routine GP work; underutilization is a known issue
- **Engagement Potential**: High — GPs can discuss prescribing patterns, CDS tools, barriers to optimal prescribing
- **Risk**: Low — Clinical focus, not vendor-focused
- **NZ Relevance**: High — CKD management is universal GP practice
- **Note**: Medscape may require login, but content is highly relevant

### 7. NZ Herald: "Space tech, smart sensors and AI drive new hope for cerebral palsy"
**URL**: https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/space-tech-smart-sensors-and-ai-drive-new-hope-for-cerebral-palsy/UOINB5GR6VEOVJ5IJBSYPLQARA/

**Topic**: Auckland Bioengineering Institute research using NASA tech for cerebral palsy rehabilitation

**Evaluation**: ⚠️ **MAYBE** (Borderline)
- **Reason**: Interesting innovation story but not directly GP practice-relevant
- **GP Relevance**: Low-Medium — GPs may refer children with CP but don't manage rehabilitation directly
- **Engagement Potential**: Medium — Interesting story but may not generate GP discussion
- **Risk**: Low (not vendor-focused) but also low GP relevance
- **NZ Relevance**: High (Auckland research) but specialist focus
- **Recommendation**: **SKIP** unless you need a 4th-5th item and want NZ innovation angle

## Summary & Recommendations

### ✅ **INCLUDE** (2 articles):
1. **BMC Primary Care** — Cognitive impairment CDS (Primary care, highly relevant)
2. **Medscape** — ACEI/ARB CDS for CKD (Clinical, GP-relevant)

### ❌ **EXCLUDE** (3 articles):
1. **The Post** — Investment trends (Not GP-relevant)
2. **IT Brief** — Accenture AI (Vendor-focused, high risk)
3. **Yahoo News** — AI transcription startup (Likely vendor-focused)

### ⚠️ **BORDERLINE** (2 articles):
1. **MedTechIQ** — Pacific data sovereignty (Important but abstract)
2. **NZ Herald** — Cerebral palsy research (Interesting but specialist-focused)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Include 2 articles**:
- BMC Primary Care (cognitive impairment CDS)
- Medscape (ACEI/ARB CDS for CKD)

**Why these two**:
- Both are **highly GP-relevant** (primary care, clinical decision support)
- Both address **common GP practice issues** (cognitive screening, CKD management)
- Both are **not vendor-focused** (research/clinical focus)
- Both have **high engagement potential** (GPs can discuss their experience)
- **Thematic coherence** — both about clinical decision support tools

**Skip the others**:
- Investment article: Wrong audience
- Accenture article: Vendor-focused (exactly what Week 1 showed to avoid)
- Startup article: Likely vendor-focused
- Borderline articles: Not strong enough GP relevance

---

## Post Theme Suggestion

**Theme**: "Clinical Decision Support Tools in Primary Care"

**Hook**: "Two new studies show how clinical decision support tools can help GPs manage common conditions — but are they working in your practice?"

This theme:
- Connects both articles
- Asks GP-focused question (encourages GP engagement)
- Avoids vendor language
- Focuses on practical GP practice
