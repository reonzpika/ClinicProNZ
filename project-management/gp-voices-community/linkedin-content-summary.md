# LinkedIn Weekly Content - Validation Experiment

**Status**: Active Validation (Week 1/6 complete)  
**Goal**: Test if GPs want curated NZ healthcare news before building automation  
**Strategy**: Manual curation → Validate demand → Automate only if proven

---

## Validation Criteria

**Success = GP/Practice Manager Engagement**
- ✅ GPs commenting on posts
- ✅ Practice managers saving/sharing content
- ✅ Target audience following for weekly updates
- ✅ Questions/requests for more frequent/detailed summaries

**Vanity Metrics (Don't Count)**
- ❌ AI tool vendor engagement (not target audience)
- ❌ Total reactions without audience context
- ❌ Impressions without conversion

**Decision Timeline**: 4-6 weeks of weekly posts

**Threshold for "Demand Proven"**:
- At least 3-5 GP/practice manager comments per post (on average)
- At least 10 new GP followers (not vendors) over 4-6 weeks
- At least 2-3 saves per post (indicates reference value)
- Requests for more frequent updates or specific topics

**If Validation Succeeds**:
- Build automated news curation workflow
- Sources: BPAC, NZ Doctor, Pharmac, HQSC, Ministry of Health, RNZCGP, etc.
- Automated extraction, summarisation, and draft generation
- Human review before posting (keep editorial control)

**If Validation Fails**:
- Stop weekly posts after 6 weeks
- Pivot to different content strategy or abandon LinkedIn approach

## Weekly Post Performance

### Week 1: 2025-11-08

**Topic**: AI in healthcare - scribe technology and AI-enabled practice management systems  
**Items**: 4 items

**Metrics**:
- Profile viewers from this post: 3
- Followers gained from this post: **8 new followers** (initially reported as 1, corrected)
- Reactions: 3
- Comments: 8
- Saves: 2
- Link clicks: 1

**Audience Analysis**:
- ⚠️ **Most reactions from AI tool vendors, not GPs/practice managers**
- This is the critical insight - engagement volume ≠ validation
- Need to track WHO is engaging, not just HOW MANY

**Learnings**:
- Vendor engagement doesn't validate demand from target audience
- Need better tracking of follower/commenter roles (GP vs vendor)
- 8 new followers is promising, but need to verify they're GPs
- 2 saves suggests content has reference value
- Low link clicks (1) - may need stronger CTA

**Action for Next Post**:
- Check profiles of new followers (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Check profiles of commenters (are they GPs or vendors?)
- Track audience quality, not just quantity

### Week 2: 2025-11-15 (Planned)

**Status**: News curation in progress  
**Target Post Date**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm NZST

**News Items**: [To be collected]

**Strategy Adjustments**:
- Focus on topics more relevant to GP practice (less vendor-focused)
- Add stronger link CTA to test if better placement drives clicks
- Ask engagement questions that GPs (not vendors) can answer
