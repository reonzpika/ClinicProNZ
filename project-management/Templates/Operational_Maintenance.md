# Operational Maintenance Template

## Purpose of This Stage/Scenario
Manage and maintain a production SaaS application. This stage focuses on monitoring, incident handling, feature development, performance optimisation, and operational excellence for mature products.

## Key Questions for Founders
- What are your key operational metrics and KPIs?
- How do you monitor system health and performance?
- What's your incident response process?
- How do you prioritise feature development vs maintenance?
- What's your deployment and release process?
- How do you track costs and optimise infrastructure?
- What's your user feedback and support process?

## Common Documents to Prepare
- Operational runbook
- Incident response procedures
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Feature backlog and prioritisation
- Cost tracking and optimisation reports
- Performance metrics dashboard
- User feedback and support logs
- Deployment and release notes

## Typical Milestones and Checkpoints
1. **Monitoring Setup** - Implement metrics, alerts, and dashboards
2. **Incident Response** - Define and document incident procedures
3. **Feature Backlog** - Prioritise and plan feature development
4. **Performance Optimisation** - Identify and fix bottlenecks
5. **Cost Optimisation** - Track and reduce operational costs
6. **User Feedback Loop** - Establish feedback collection and response process
7. **Release Cycle** - Standardise deployment and release process

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Ignoring technical debt: Accumulating code quality issues
- No monitoring: Flying blind in production
- Poor incident response: Slow or chaotic incident handling
- Feature creep: Adding features without validating need
- Cost blind spots: Not tracking or optimising costs
- Missing user feedback: Building features users don't need
- No release process: Chaotic deployments causing issues

## Example Prompts for AI to Reference During Setup Conversations
- "What metrics matter most for your SaaS? Let's set up monitoring."
- "How do you handle incidents? Let's document your incident response process."
- "What features are users requesting? Let's prioritise your backlog."
- "What are your biggest cost drivers? Let's track and optimise costs."
- "How do you collect user feedback? Let's establish a feedback loop."
- "What's your deployment process? Let's standardise releases."
