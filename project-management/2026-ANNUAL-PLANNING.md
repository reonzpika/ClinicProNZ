# 2026 Annual Planning

**Created**: January 1, 2026
**Purpose**: Strategic planning and resource allocation for all active projects across 2026

---

## Planning Framework

This document guides annual planning across 5 key areas:
1. **2025 Reflection** - What we achieved and learned
2. **2026 Vision** - Where we want to be by end of year
3. **Resource Reality** - Time, money, energy constraints
4. **Strategic Prioritisation** - What gets focus vs what gets maintenance
5. **Execution Plan** - Quarterly milestones and success metrics

---

## Part 1: 2025 Reflection

### Major Achievements

**ClinicPro SaaS**
- Production operational; used daily by founder
- Stripe billing configured
- Clinical notes API improvements
- Full-stack Next.js application mature

**Medtech Integration**
- 🎉 MILESTONE: POST Media validated - widget can upload images
- OAuth service completed
- BFF deployed and operational
- FHIR API testing complete (7 endpoints)
- 3-phase development roadmap created

**R&D Grant Submission**
- 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE: Objectives completely revised (v3.0)
- Focused scope: 2 core tools (Inbox Helper + Care Gap Finder)
- Dual PMS integration strategy (Medtech + Indici)
- Budget expanded to $175k total costs ($70k grant request)
- Medtech partnership letter confirmed
- Financial structure optimised (v3.5)
- Application polish complete (v4.4)

**GP Voices Community**
- Project initialised
- Theme components implemented
- LinkedIn validation experiment launched (Week 1 complete)

**Project Management AI SaaS**
- 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE: Working prototype complete
- Modular rule system operational (15 files, 843 lines)
- Autonomous updates system implemented
- Being actively dogfooded
- Stage moved: Validation → Build

### Key Lessons from 2025

1. **Revenue clarity matters**: Medtech integration identified as clearest revenue path (3,000+ GP customer base vs competitive ClinicPro market)

2. **Focus drives progress**: R&D grant focused from 50+ tools to 2 core tools; application improved dramatically

3. **Validation before building**: GP Voices doing LinkedIn validation before automating content

4. **Working prototype beats planning**: PM AI SaaS became real when we started dogfooding it

5. **Ask critical questions first**: R&D grant lesson - define "What's the most important question?" BEFORE engaging advisers

6. **Solo founder reality**: Limited time/resources require brutal prioritisation of highest ROI activities

### What Didn't Work in 2025

- [TO FILL: What projects stalled? What approaches failed? What consumed time without results?]

### What Surprised You in 2025

- [TO FILL: Unexpected wins? Market responses? Technical challenges?]

## Part 2: 2026 Vision

### End of Year Success Picture

*By December 31, 2026, what does success look like?*

**Revenue Goals**
- **8k MRR average** (lower at beginning, increases as features launch)
- **20+ GP clinics** using Medtech features
- Pricing: $50/clinic/month OR $20/GP/month (to be tested)
- Target market: 100+ GPs eventually

**Product Milestones**
- **5 Medtech features launched** (Q1-Q4)
- Features are focused, AI-powered integrations for legacy Medtech software
- Bundle pricing introduced (Q3/Q4)
- R&D grant project underway (if approved)

**Market Position**
- **One of the most famous GPs specialised in AI**
- Consistent online presence (2-3 posts/week via Ting)
- Known for bringing AI to legacy healthcare software
- PHO and clinic relationships established

**Team/Capability**
- Still founder + Ting (partnership structure)
- Ting: Social media, R&D operations, PM SaaS testing
- Founder: Product development, GP relationships, technical work

**Personal Life**
- GP work: 4 days/week (may reduce to 3 days if grant approved)
- Sustainable pace maintained
- Clear work boundaries

### Non-Negotiables for 2026

*What MUST happen this year?*

1. **Generate revenue**: At least paying customers on Medtech features (failure = $0 revenue again)
2. **Launch Image feature**: End of January 2026 (entry point to feature collection)
3. **R&D grant decision**: Know by end January; execute if approved
4. **Kill/pivot decisively**: If no paying customers by Feature #2 launch, pivot or kill project

### Nice-to-Haves for 2026

*What would be great but isn't essential?*

- PM AI SaaS becomes viable product (test with Ting Q1; decide May/June)
- GP Voices Community gains traction organically
- Speaking engagements or podcast appearances (builds "famous GP in AI" goal)
- ClinicPro finds product-market fit if Medtech features create integration opportunity

---

## Part 3: Resource Reality Check

### Time Constraints

**Scenario A: R&D Grant APPROVED**
- GP clinical work: 32 hrs/week (4 days)
- R&D project work: 30 hrs/week (grant requirement)
- Medtech development: ~10 hrs/week maximum
- Marketing/sales: Minimal (supported by Ting)
- **Total: ~72 hrs/week** (high intensity)

**Realistic expectations with grant:**
- 2-3 Medtech features (not 5)
- 5-10 clinics (not 20)
- 2-4k MRR (not 8k)
- "Famous GP in AI" unlikely without dedicated content time

**Option: Reduce GP to 3 days/week (24 hrs)**
- Creates 15 hrs/week for Medtech + marketing
- Total: ~70 hrs/week
- Better chance at hitting all goals

**Scenario B: R&D Grant REJECTED**
- GP clinical work: 32 hrs/week (4 days)
- Medtech development: 30-40 hrs/week
- Marketing/sales: Included in above
- Social media: Handled by Ting
- **Total: ~65-70 hrs/week**

**Full goals achievable:**
- 5 Medtech features possible
- 20 clinics possible (requires sales hustle)
- 8k MRR possible (if pricing validated)

### Financial Constraints

**Runway**
- GP income: Covers all living expenses + business costs
- No panic date: Sustainable indefinitely
- Flexible: Can increase GP hours if needed

**Expected Income 2026**
- GP clinical income: Primary income source (4 days/week)
- Medtech features: $0 → $8k MRR target (by end of year)
- R&D Grant (if approved): $286,770 over 24 months (40% of $716,926 total costs)

**Investment Capacity**
- Low-cost features prioritised (running costs minimal)
- Bootstrap approach: Solo founder + Ting
- R&D grant provides funding if approved

### Energy/Sustainability Constraints

**Current State**
- Financially stable (no stress from runway)
- 5 active projects with zero revenue (risk of burnout if continues)
- Need decisive kill/pivot signals to avoid spinning wheels

**Sustainability Requirements**
- Clear decision points (no endless building without validation)
- Revenue generation to validate effort
- Ting partnership for support/shared workload
- Flexible GP hours as pressure relief valve

---

## Part 4: Strategic Prioritisation

### Project Portfolio Assessment

| Project | Stage | ROI Potential | Time Required | Strategic Fit | 2026 Priority |
|---------|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **ClinicPro SaaS** | Operational | Low (free competition) | 0 hrs (maintenance only) | Support | **Maintain** - Used daily by founder; no active development; revisit if Medtech integration creates opportunity |
| **Medtech Integration** | Build | **HIGH** (GP validated, niche market) | High (primary focus) | **Core Revenue** | **GROWTH** - Primary 2026 revenue bet; 5 focused AI features for legacy software |
| **GP Voices Community** | Build | Medium (brand building) | Low (Ting handles) | Support (brand) | **Maintain** - Ting runs LinkedIn (2-3 posts/week); builds "famous GP in AI" presence; ongoing regardless |
| **R&D Grant Project** | Validation (submitted) | High (if approved: $286k funding) | 30 hrs/week (if approved) | Core (if approved) | **CONDITIONAL** - Awaiting decision (end Jan); if approved becomes mandatory commitment |
| **PM AI SaaS** | Build | Unknown (testing) | Low (until validated) | Potential | **TEST** - Ting tests Feb/Mar; go/no-go decision May/Jun; kill if not useful to her |

### The One Thing

*If you could only work on ONE project in 2026, which would it be and why?*

**Medtech Integration features**

Why: GP-validated demand, niche market (not competing with free alternatives), brings AI to legacy software, modular revenue model (start small, bundle later), fastest path to revenue, leverages existing GP network and clinical expertise.

### Strategic Bets for 2026

**Bet #1: Modular Medtech Features = Revenue**
- **Thesis**: GPs will pay for focused AI features deeply integrated into their daily Medtech workflow; entry-level pricing ($20/GP or $50/clinic) with bundle pricing later
- **If this works**: Clear revenue model; scale to 100+ GPs; build feature collection; become known as "AI for Medtech" specialist
- **If this fails** (no paying customers by Feature #2): Pivot to different features or reassess pricing/market
- **Investment required**: Primary time focus (~30-40 hrs/week if no grant; ~10 hrs/week if grant approved)
- **Success signal by**: End of Q2 (June 2026) - paying customers exist or pivot executed

**Bet #2: R&D Grant Provides Runway + Credibility**
- **Thesis**: If approved, $286k over 24 months provides financial runway and validation of clinical AI capability
- **If this works**: 2 years funded R&D; builds deeper AI capability; potential for larger future grants or partnerships
- **If this fails** (rejected): Double down on Medtech features as sole revenue path; potentially reduce GP hours
- **Investment required**: 30 hrs/week commitment (mandatory if approved)
- **Success signal by**: End of January 2026 - approval decision received

**Bet #3: Online Presence = Inbound Opportunities**
- **Thesis**: Consistent LinkedIn presence (2-3 posts/week via Ting) builds reputation as "famous GP in AI"; creates inbound leads for Medtech features
- **If this works**: Organic marketing channel; PHO/clinic relationships; speaking opportunities; reduced sales effort
- **If this fails**: Minimal harm (Ting handles, low time cost); focus remains on direct outreach
- **Investment required**: Ting's time (founder approval/input only)
- **Success signal by**: Ongoing follower growth + engagement quality (GPs not just vendors)

### What to Stop Doing in 2026

**Stop:**
- **Building without paying customers**: No more "hoping" features will generate revenue; validate pricing before Feature #2 launches
- **ClinicPro AI Scribe active development**: Maintenance mode; competing with free alternatives is not viable without Medtech integration
- **Keeping projects alive without kill signals**: PM AI SaaS dies if Ting doesn't find it useful (May/Jun decision); Medtech pivots if no customers by Feature #2
- **Juggling too many priorities**: R&D grant (if approved) + Medtech is enough; everything else is maintenance or testing

---

## Part 5: 2026 Execution Plan

**Note**: Two scenarios depending on R&D grant decision (end of January)

---

### Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar): Foundation Quarter

**Primary Focus**: Launch Image feature + Get grant decision + Start customer acquisition

**Key Milestones**:
- **End of January**: Medtech Image feature launched (first feature in collection)
- **End of January**: R&D grant decision received (determines rest of year)
- **February**: First 3-5 GP clinics testing Image feature
- **March**: Feature #2 development starts (timeline depends on grant decision)
- **Feb/Mar**: Ting starts testing PM AI SaaS

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Image feature live and working
- ✅ Grant decision known (approve or reject)
- ✅ 5-10 paying clinics by end of Q1 (validates revenue model)
- ✅ GTM motion started (PHO outreach, direct GP outreach, Medtech marketing)

**Resources Allocated**:
- **Everyone's path**: Image feature completion (1-2 weeks); Ting social media (2-3 posts/week)
- **If grant approved**: 30 hrs/week R&D starts; ~10 hrs/week Medtech
- **If grant rejected**: ~30-40 hrs/week Medtech focus; aggressive customer acquisition

---

### Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun): Validation Quarter

**Primary Focus**: Feature #2 launch + CRITICAL DECISION POINTS

**Scenario A: Grant Approved**
- **April**: Feature #2 built and launched (slower pace due to R&D commitment)
- **May/June**: PM AI SaaS go/no-go decision (is Ting finding it useful?)
- **June**: 10-15 paying clinics target
- R&D project running smoothly (30 hrs/week)

**Scenario B: Grant Rejected**
- **April**: Feature #2 launched
- **May/June**: Feature #3 launched
- **May/June**: PM AI SaaS go/no-go decision (is Ting finding it useful?)
- **June**: 15-20 paying clinics target (aggressive acquisition)

**CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - End of Q2:**
- **Are there paying customers by Feature #2?** 
  - ✅ YES → Continue Medtech strategy
  - ❌ NO → PIVOT or KILL project
- **Does Ting find PM AI SaaS useful?**
  - ✅ YES → Start building product (Q3/Q4 or 2027)
  - ❌ NO → KILL project

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Feature #2 has paying customers OR decisive pivot executed
- ✅ PM AI SaaS decision made (go or no-go)
- ✅ 10-20 clinics paying (depends on grant scenario)
- ✅ Clear revenue trajectory visible

**Resources Allocated**:
- **Grant approved**: 30 hrs/week R&D + 10 hrs/week Medtech
- **Grant rejected**: 30-40 hrs/week Medtech + sales
- **Both scenarios**: Ting handling social media + R&D ops (if grant)

---

**If Medtech Working (paying customers exist):**
- **July**: Feature #3 launched
- **August**: Feature #4 launched
- **September**: Feature #5 launched
- Bundle pricing strategy introduced (Q3/Q4)
- Customer support scaling (Ting involvement?)
- 15-20+ clinics target

**If Medtech Not Working (no customers by Q2):**
- Pivot to different feature set based on GP feedback?
- Reassess entire Medtech strategy?
- Increase GP clinical hours; treat projects as side experiments?
- Focus on R&D grant (if approved) as primary path?

**If PM AI SaaS Validated in Q2:**
- Start building PM AI SaaS product (Q3/Q4)
- Both founder + Ting dogfooding daily
- Early access for other solo founders

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ Clear revenue trajectory (5k+ MRR)
- ✅ 15-20 clinics paying
- ✅ Bundle pricing tested or launched
- ✅ R&D project major milestone (if approved)

**Resources Allocated**:
- Same as Q2 (depends on grant scenario)
- Potential: Consider reducing GP to 3 days/week if revenue shows promise

---

### Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec): Results Quarter

**Primary Focus**: Hit year-end targets OR set up 2027 strategy

**If Medtech Traction Exists:**
- Approaching 20+ clinics
- 5k-8k MRR (depends on grant scenario)
- 5 features launched total (or close)
- Bundle pricing optimised
- Social media presence established ("famous GP in AI" visibility)
- R&D project major milestone (if approved)

**If PM AI SaaS Launched:**
- Building PM AI SaaS product actively
- Both founder + Ting using daily
- Early access program for solo founders
- Revenue secondary to validation

**If Pivoted in Q3:**
- New strategy executing
- Learning from Medtech attempt
- Setting foundation for 2027

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ 8k MRR average (primary goal)
- ✅ 20 clinics paying
- ✅ 5 Medtech features launched (or clear explanation why not)
- ✅ "Famous GP in AI" online presence (follower count, engagement quality)
- ✅ Sustainable pace maintained

**Resources Allocated**:
- Same as Q2-Q3 (depends on grant scenario)
- Begin 2027 planning in December

## Risk Assessment

### Top Risks to 2026 Plan

**Risk #1: No paying customers by Feature #2 (Q2)**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (GP validation done, but pricing untested)
- **Impact**: High (entire Medtech strategy fails; back to zero revenue)
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Validate pricing with first 5 GPs immediately after Image feature launch
  - Clear kill signal: If no customers by Feature #2, pivot don't persist
  - Low entry pricing ($20/GP or $50/clinic) reduces barrier
  - Direct outreach to known GPs (warm leads)

**Risk #2: R&D grant approved but overcommits time (70+ hrs/week unsustainable)**
- **Likelihood**: High (if grant approved and trying to hit full Medtech goals)
- **Impact**: High (burnout; neither project succeeds; health/relationships suffer)
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Reduce GP to 3 days/week if grant approved (creates 15 hrs/week buffer)
  - Accept lower Medtech targets with grant (2-3 features, 10 clinics, 2-4k MRR)
  - Ting takes more operational load (social media, R&D ops, customer support)
  - Monitor energy levels; adjust quickly if unsustainable

**Risk #3: Building in isolation without market feedback**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (founder tendency to build first, ask later)
- **Impact**: Medium (waste time on wrong features; pricing misaligned)
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Talk to GPs after EVERY feature launch (what's next? what's valuable?)
  - Test pricing early (don't assume $50/clinic is right)
  - Share WIP on LinkedIn via Ting (get public feedback)
  - PHO partnerships provide ongoing GP access

**Risk #4: Technical complexity blocks progress (FHIR/ALEX API)**
- **Likelihood**: Medium (already experienced with Image feature)
- **Impact**: Medium (delays launch dates; frustration; budget overrun)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prioritise "easy to build" features (as stated in strategy)
  - Budget 2x time estimates for technical unknowns
  - Engage Medtech support early when stuck
  - Document learnings (get faster over time)

### Early Warning Signals

*What metrics or signals indicate the plan is off track?*

**Financial Warning Signals:**
- End of Q1 (March): Zero paying customers after Image feature launch
- End of Q2 (June): Still zero revenue after Feature #2
- Consistently missing pricing targets ($20/GP feels too high; GPs push back)

**Customer/Market Warning Signals:**
- GPs say "nice but wouldn't pay" after seeing Image feature
- Medtech blocks or complicates integration (API changes, policy changes)
- Competitors launch similar features (free or cheaper)
- PHOs unresponsive to outreach

**Personal Sustainability Warning Signals:**
- Working 70+ hrs/week for more than 2 months consecutively
- Dreading work on Medtech features (lost motivation)
- Relationships suffering; health declining
- Ting expressing concern about pace

**Technical/Product Warning Signals:**
- Features taking 2x longer than estimated consistently
- FHIR/ALEX API changes breaking existing features
- Customer support consuming >10 hrs/week
- Quality issues (bugs, downtime) due to rushed development

### Pivot Triggers

*Under what conditions would you change the plan?*

**Abandon Medtech Integration Project:**
- No paying customers by end of Q2 (June 2026) after Feature #2 launch
- Medtech changes API/policy making integration unviable
- Technical complexity proves unsustainable (constantly breaking)
- Competitor launches free alternative that's better

**Go All-In on One Thing:**
- Medtech hits 10+ paying clinics by end of Q2 → Reduce GP to 3 days, double down
- R&D grant approved and showing exceptional progress → Reduce Medtech to maintenance, focus R&D
- PM AI SaaS shows exceptional traction with Ting + early users → Pivot to building this as primary product

**External Changes Requiring Strategy Shift:**
- Medtech acquired or changes business model dramatically
- Major competitor enters market (e.g., Heidi launches Medtech integration)
- Healthcare policy changes affecting GP workflows
- Economic downturn affecting GP willingness to pay for tools
- R&D grant approval with unexpected conditions/constraints

## Notes & Decisions

*Use this section to capture decisions, insights, and changes as the year progresses*

### January 2026

**2026-01-01**: Annual planning document created

**Key Decisions Made During Planning:**

1. **Primary revenue bet**: Medtech feature collection (modular AI features for legacy software)
   - GP-validated demand
   - Niche market (not competing with free alternatives)
   - Entry pricing: $50/clinic/month or $20/GP/month
   - Target: 100+ GPs eventually

2. **Two-scenario planning**: Plan depends on R&D grant decision (end of January)
   - Scenario A (Grant Approved): 30 hrs/week R&D + reduced Medtech expectations
   - Scenario B (Grant Rejected): Full focus on Medtech + aggressive customer acquisition

3. **Clear kill signals established**:
   - No paying customers by Feature #2 (Q2) → Pivot or kill Medtech
   - Ting doesn't find PM AI SaaS useful → Kill project (decision by May/Jun)
   - No more building without revenue validation

4. **Project priorities set**:
   - **GROWTH**: Medtech Integration (primary focus)
   - **CONDITIONAL**: R&D Grant (if approved, becomes mandatory)
   - **MAINTAIN**: ClinicPro (maintenance mode), GP Voices (Ting handles)
   - **TEST**: PM AI SaaS (validate with Ting; decide May/Jun)

5. **Sustainability boundaries**:
   - Maximum 70 hrs/week sustained work
   - Option to reduce GP to 3 days/week if grant approved
   - Ting partnership critical for support/shared workload

6. **2025 reflection completed**: Zero revenue across 5 projects; 2026 must prioritise monetisation over building
