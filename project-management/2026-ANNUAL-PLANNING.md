# 2026 Annual Planning

**Created**: January 1, 2026
**Purpose**: Strategic planning and resource allocation for all active projects across 2026

---

## Planning Framework

This document guides annual planning across 5 key areas:
1. **2025 Reflection** - What we achieved and learned
2. **2026 Vision** - Where we want to be by end of year
3. **Resource Reality** - Time, money, energy constraints
4. **Strategic Prioritisation** - What gets focus vs what gets maintenance
5. **Execution Plan** - Quarterly milestones and success metrics

---

## Part 1: 2025 Reflection

### Major Achievements

**ClinicPro SaaS**
- Production operational; used daily by founder
- Stripe billing configured
- Clinical notes API improvements
- Full-stack Next.js application mature

**Medtech Integration**
- 🎉 MILESTONE: POST Media validated - widget can upload images
- OAuth service completed
- BFF deployed and operational
- FHIR API testing complete (7 endpoints)
- 3-phase development roadmap created

**R&D Grant Submission**
- 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE: Objectives completely revised (v3.0)
- Focused scope: 2 core tools (Inbox Helper + Care Gap Finder)
- Dual PMS integration strategy (Medtech + Indici)
- Budget expanded to $175k total costs ($70k grant request)
- Medtech partnership letter confirmed
- Financial structure optimised (v3.5)
- Application polish complete (v4.4)

**GP Voices Community**
- Project initialised
- Theme components implemented
- LinkedIn validation experiment launched (Week 1 complete)

**Project Management AI SaaS**
- 🎉 MAJOR MILESTONE: Working prototype complete
- Modular rule system operational (15 files, 843 lines)
- Autonomous updates system implemented
- Being actively dogfooded
- Stage moved: Validation → Build

### Key Lessons from 2025

1. **Revenue clarity matters**: Medtech integration identified as clearest revenue path (3,000+ GP customer base vs competitive ClinicPro market)

2. **Focus drives progress**: R&D grant focused from 50+ tools to 2 core tools; application improved dramatically

3. **Validation before building**: GP Voices doing LinkedIn validation before automating content

4. **Working prototype beats planning**: PM AI SaaS became real when we started dogfooding it

5. **Ask critical questions first**: R&D grant lesson - define "What's the most important question?" BEFORE engaging advisers

6. **Solo founder reality**: Limited time/resources require brutal prioritisation of highest ROI activities
