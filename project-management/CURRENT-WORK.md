## Top priorities (this week)
1. Validate Medtech Evolution Phase 1D UI in local facility `F99669-C` (Inbox + Daily Record) and unblock READ/search behaviour as needed.
2. Customer-side launch prep for Medtech Images (pricing constraints, competitor pricing, tester follow-up).
3. Keep system stable; minimal maintenance for non-primary projects.

## Active work queue (max 10)
- [ ] Bring `F99669-C` online (Windows desktop always-on; Hybrid Connection Manager running) and capture Phase 1D UI evidence.
- [ ] Once `F99669-C` is online: run local read tests and capture evidence (status codes, correlation IDs).
- [ ] Follow up Medtech support reply on ALEX UAT search 403 despite roles; adjust approach once clarified.
- [ ] Wait for Medtech commercial terms reply; update pricing approach accordingly.
- [ ] Wait for Intellimed (QuickShot) pricing reply; compare positioning.
- [ ] Send 1–2 messages to GP testers once Phase 1D UI is confirmed.
- [ ] Coordinate with Ting for a post once Phase 1D UI is confirmed.

## Recent context (last 3 sessions)

## Constraints and targets (this week)
- Customer work target: 5 touches; current: 1/5.
- Active build projects: 2 (Medtech Integration primary; PM AI SaaS maintenance only).
- Key blocker: local facility `F99669-C` depends on Windows desktop tunnel staying awake; ALEX UAT search currently 403 for non-Patient resources despite token roles.

## Key metrics (quick)
- Paying clinics: 0 (target: 5 by end of Q1)

- Features launched: 0/5 (target: 1 by Jan 31)
