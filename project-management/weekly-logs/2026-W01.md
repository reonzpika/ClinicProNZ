# Week 1, 2026 (Jan 1-5)

## Weekly Review

### Last Week (Week 52, 2025)

**What was accomplished:**
- Annual planning completed (2026-ANNUAL-PLANNING.md)
- PM AI SaaS rule system redesigned
- 2026 strategy defined (Q1 goals: Launch Image feature, 5-10 paying clinics)

**What was learned:**
- Need clearer daily focus (implemented CURRENT-FOCUS.md)
- Customer work needs to be prioritized (30% time allocation)
- Multiple projects cause overwhelm (limited to 2 active projects max)

---

## This Week's Plan

### ONE Big Win

**Implement Redis + S3 session storage, mobile upload UI with real backend, and Ably sync (Phase 1B complete). Prepare GP tester list and sign-up form for February launch.**

### Active Projects

**Primary**: Medtech Integration (Phase 1B)
- Goal: Complete Redis + S3 + mobile UI + Ably sync + dataflow review
- Time: 16-20 hours (2-3 project days available after GP work)

**Secondary**: PM AI SaaS
- Goal: Weekly planning system working (dogfooding this system now)
- Time: 2-3 hours (maintenance/improvements as needed)

### Customer Outreach Targets

Plan to contact 5 GPs/stakeholders this week:
1. Draft GP email announcing Image feature (end of week after Phase 1 complete)
2. Create Google Form for tester sign-ups
3. Coordinate with Ting on LinkedIn content plan for Image feature launch
4. [Deferred to next week] Text 2-3 GPs about early access
5. [Deferred to next week] Review PHO contact list for partnership outreach

### Time Allocation Plan

- Building: 16-20 hours (Phase 1B Medtech)
- Customer/Business: 2 hours (email, form, Ting coordination)
- GP Work: 32 hours (4 days)

## Daily Log

### Monday, Jan 1
- Public holiday (New Year's Day)
- No project work

### Tuesday, Jan 2
**✅ Phase 1B Implementation Complete (5 hours total)**

**What was accomplished:**
- ✅ Redis session service implemented (Upstash) - Per-encounter storage with 2-hour TTL (~30 min)
- ✅ S3 image service implemented (AWS) - Presigned URLs with auto-retry (3 attempts, exponential backoff) (~30 min)
- ✅ Created 5 Vercel API endpoints - Session create, token validate, presigned URL, add image, get images (~1.5 hours)
- ✅ Mobile page complete rewrite - Full 7-screen flow with metadata capture (laterality + body site) (~2 hours)
- ✅ Desktop Ably listener implemented - Real-time sync with eager fetch (~30 min)
- ✅ Build fixes applied - Type safety for mobile uploads (11 files updated), Ably SSR compatibility (~1 hour)
- ✅ Documentation updated - PROJECT_SUMMARY, DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP, PHASE_1B_COMPLETE, CURRENT-FOCUS (~15 min)

**Code stats:**
- ~1,500 lines written
- 13 files created/modified
- 0 new dependencies (used existing: @upstash/redis, @aws-sdk/client-s3, ably, browser-image-compression)

**Decisions made:**
- Session scope: Per-encounter (not per-user) - prevents wrong-patient uploads
- Mobile metadata: Captured on mobile (laterality + body site) - fresh context while patient present
- Real-time sync: Ably with eager fetch (not polling) - existing infrastructure, better UX
- Error recovery: Auto-retry with 3 attempts, exponential backoff - handles transient failures
- Build approach: Fix all type errors immediately - ensure production-ready code

**Blockers encountered:**
- None (all resolved)

## Customer Conversations

### Conversation 1: [GP Name] - [Date]
**Method**: [Text/Email/Call/Coffee]
**Topic**: [What was discussed]
**Key insights**:
- [What did you learn?]
- [Any feature requests?]
- [Willingness to pay?]
**Follow-up**: [What's next?]

### Conversation 2: [Name] - [Date]
[Same format]

## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Session Scope - Per-Encounter (Not Per-User)
**Date**: Jan 2, 2026
**Context**: Phase 1B architecture - how to scope Redis sessions for mobile → desktop sync
**Decision**: Use `encounter:{encounterId}` as Redis key (one session per patient/encounter), not `user:{userId}`
**Rationale**: 
- Prevents wrong-patient uploads (safer clinically)
- Matches GP workflow (one encounter = one session)
- Clear lifecycle (session expires when encounter ends)
- Aligns with PROJECT_RULES.md and FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md
**Impact**: 
- ✅ Safer patient data handling
- ✅ Simpler session cleanup
- ⚠️ Slightly more complex QR token (must include encounter context)

### Decision 2: Mobile Metadata Capture (Not Desktop-Only)
**Date**: Jan 2, 2026
**Context**: Whether to capture laterality + body site on mobile or defer to desktop
**Decision**: Implement full metadata capture on mobile (7-screen flow)
**Rationale**:
- Metadata captured while patient context fresh (GP remembers which ear)
- FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md explicitly recommends mobile metadata capture
- Faster overall workflow (capture + metadata in one step)
- Desktop can focus on review/validation
**Impact**:
- ✅ Better clinical accuracy
- ✅ Faster desktop workflow
- ⚠️ Slightly longer implementation (7 screens vs 4 screens)

### Decision 3: Real-Time Sync - Ably (Not Polling)
**Date**: Jan 2, 2026
**Context**: How to sync mobile uploads to desktop in real-time
**Decision**: Use Ably for real-time sync (existing infrastructure), not polling
**Rationale**:
- Already integrated and working (zero setup cost)
- Free tier sufficient (200 connections, 100k messages/day)
- Better UX (instant sync vs 3-second delay)
- Auto-reconnect and message replay built-in
**Impact**:
- ✅ Instant image appearance on desktop
- ✅ No wasted API calls (polling would query empty sessions)
- ⚠️ Required SSR compatibility fix (dynamic import)

### Decision 4: Image Fetch Strategy - Eager (Not Lazy)
**Date**: Jan 2, 2026
**Context**: When to fetch images from S3 - immediately or on-demand
**Decision**: Eager fetch (download all images immediately on Ably notification)
**Rationale**:
- Images already compressed (<1MB each)
- GP will likely review all images anyway
- Simpler state management (no tracking of what's loaded)
- Faster preview when GP clicks thumbnail
**Impact**:
- ✅ No loading delay when clicking thumbnails
- ✅ Simpler code
- ⚠️ Uses more bandwidth (but acceptable at <1MB per image)

### Decision 5: Error Recovery - Auto-Retry (3 Attempts)
**Date**: Jan 2, 2026
**Context**: How to handle transient network failures (common in GP clinics)
**Decision**: Auto-retry with 3 attempts, exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
**Rationale**:
- GP clinics often have flaky internet (rural ADSL)
- Better UX (handles transient failures automatically)
- ts-retry-promise already installed (zero cost)
- Simple to implement (wrap fetch calls)
**Impact**:
- ✅ Resilient to network failures
- ✅ Better UX (no manual retry needed)
- ⚠️ Slightly slower on persistent failures (7s total vs immediate error)
