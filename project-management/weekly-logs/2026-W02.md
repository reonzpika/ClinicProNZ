# Week 2, 2026 (Jan 6-12)

## Daily Log

### Tuesday, Jan 6
- ✅ Phase 1B testing completed; production-ready (see Week 1 log post-week update).

### Wednesday, Jan 7
- ✅ Win: Fixed Lightsail BFF automated deployments; removed recurring `rsync` permission issue; improved reliability and diagnostics.
  - Staging now uses `/tmp/clinicpro-bff-staging-${SHA}` to avoid `/home/ubuntu` traversal (`0700`) issues.
  - Deploy runs `sudo -u deployer rsync` to `/home/deployer/app`, runs `npm ci --production --no-audit`, restarts `clinicpro-bff`, and verifies `systemctl is-active --quiet clinicpro-bff`.
  - Added better failure diagnostics (`systemctl status` and recent journal output).
