## Read order (for humans and AI)
- `PROJECT_RULES.md` (hard constraints and workflow)
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (this file; operational runbook)
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` (Phase plans; Phase 1D testing details live here)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (history)

---

## Operational runbook (single source of truth)

### Architecture (why there is a BFF)
- **Vercel (Next.js)**: hosts the widget UI and non-ALEX endpoints (dynamic IP).
- **Lightsail BFF** `api.clinicpro.co.nz`: the only component that calls **ALEX** (static IP allow-listed by Medtech).

### Environments and facility IDs (critical)
- **`F2N060-E`**: Medtech hosted UAT facility. Use for API-only checks. This will not appear inside your local Medtech Evolution UI.
- **`F99669-C`**: your local Medtech Evolution facility. Use for UI validation (Inbox and Daily Record).
  - **Important**: `F99669-C` relies on **Azure Hybrid Connection Manager** running on your Windows machine (Hybrid Connection tunnel). If that PC is asleep/standby/off, local facility connectivity can appear “offline”.

### OAuth permissions (Medtech-managed)
Medtech grants permissions at app registration/user profile level. Current known required permissions:
- **Confirmed by ALEX Support (2026-01-08)**: permissions are assigned at a **profile level**; permissions stay the same no matter the **location/facility** (for example `F2N060-E` and `F99669-C` should have the same permissions if they are using the same profile).
- `patient.media.write` (required for commit; already verified working)
- `patient.media.read` (added by Medtech; helps with retrieval/verification flows if enabled)
- `patient.task.read` (added by Medtech; supports task-related workflows)
- `patient.communication.generalcommunication.read` (added by Medtech; supports inbox/outbox retrieval where applicable)
- `patient.communication.outboxwebform.read` (added by Medtech; supports outbox web form retrieval)

### Hybrid Connection Manager (local facility `F99669-C`)
**Context**: Medtech support asked whether “Azure Hybrid Connection Manager” was stopped. In our setup, it is installed on the founder’s **personal desktop** for testing only.

**Implications**:
- If the desktop goes to **sleep/standby** or is **powered off**, the hybrid connection tunnel drops and `F99669-C` can stop working until the desktop is awake again.
- This is expected for a test-only setup; plan test windows accordingly.

**Quick checks on Windows**:
- Ensure the PC is **awake**.
- Open **Services** (`services.msc`) and confirm **Microsoft Azure Hybrid Connection Manager** is **Running**; restart if needed.
- If it keeps dropping; disable sleep/standby (at least while plugged in) during test windows.

### Canonical endpoints
- **BFF health**: `GET https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/health`
- **ALEX connectivity test (via BFF)**: `GET https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/api/medtech/test?nhi=ZZZ0016&facilityId=<FACILITY>`
- **Commit to ALEX (via widget)**: widget calls Vercel route `POST /api/medtech/attachments/commit`, which proxies to BFF.
- **Commit to ALEX (direct BFF, for smoke tests)**: `POST https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/api/medtech/session/commit`

### Logs and tracing
- **Vercel logs**: commit route logs correlationId and returned mediaIds.
- **Lightsail logs**: `sudo journalctl -u clinicpro-bff -f`
- **Correlation IDs**:
  - Commit generates a `correlationId`.
  - BFF forwards it to ALEX as `mt-correlationid`.

### Phase 1D UI validation (where to look)
- **The detailed test steps live in** `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` under Phase 1D.
- **Key point**: for UI validation you must commit into `F99669-C`.

### How to resolve the local patientId for `ZZZ0016` in `F99669-C`
- Call:
  - `GET https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/api/medtech/test?nhi=ZZZ0016&facilityId=F99669-C`
- If the response does not include a patientId, update the BFF test endpoint to include it (Lightsail BFF `index.js` can return `patientBundle.entry[0].resource.id`) and redeploy, then re-run the call above.

### Known ALEX limitations that affect debugging
- **`Media.identifier` is mandatory** on POST Media.
- **Images must be < 1MB**.
- **ALEX commonly forbids `GET /Media`** (write-only permissions); do not rely on Media search for verification. Prefer: commit, then verify in Medtech Evolution UI for Phase 1D.

---

## Current status (kept short)
- **Phase 1C complete**: commit creates FHIR `Media` in ALEX via Lightsail BFF (static IP).
- **Phase 1D in progress**: commit into local facility `F99669-C`, then confirm it appears in Medtech Evolution UI (Inbox and Daily Record).

## Recent updates (last 3-5 only)

### [2026-01-08] — Customer-side launch prep started (end-of-Jan launch readiness)

**What changed**:
- Started customer discovery and competitive intel gathering for the Medtech Images launch.
- Sent two information requests:
  - **Medtech**: request commercial terms (revenue share %, any platform fees, billing route whether direct billing allowed, payment terms).
  - **Intellimed (QuickShot)**: request pricing and inclusions (per clinic vs per GP, setup fee, monthly vs one-off, feature scope).
- Posted in NZ GP Facebook group to learn current real-world workflow for clinical photos (personal vs practice phone), tools used (QuickShot/alternatives), pain points (file size/resizing), and asked for DMs.

**Why this matters**:
- Pricing and positioning cannot be finalised in a vacuum; need both competitor pricing and Medtech commercial constraints.
- Community responses will directly shape the differentiation message and onboarding friction points to solve first.

### [2026-01-07] — Phase 1D Unblock: facilityId must be passed end-to-end (local Evo UI uses F99669-C) + tracing helpers

**What changed**:
- ✅ **Commit now requires `facilityId` end-to-end** (widget → Vercel → Lightsail BFF → ALEX header `mt-facilityid`)
  - Rationale: committing to hosted UAT facility (`F2N060-E`) will not appear in your local Medtech Evolution UI; UI validation requires your local facility (`F99669-C`)
- ✅ **Request tracing**:
  - Commit now emits a `correlationId` (returned to client and logged) and BFF forwards it to ALEX as `mt-correlationid`
  - Note: ALEX often forbids `GET /Media`; treat Media search as non-authoritative unless proven working.

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents false negatives during Phase 1D (commit “success” but nothing in UI) caused by facility mismatch.

### [2026-01-08] — Medtech permissions updated + Hybrid Connection Manager test setup clarified

**What changed**:
- ✅ Medtech confirmed the following permissions were added to our profile:
  - `patient.media.read`
  - `patient.task.read`
  - `patient.communication.generalcommunication.read`
  - `patient.communication.outboxwebform.read`
- ✅ Recorded operational constraint for local facility testing (`F99669-C`):
  - Azure Hybrid Connection Manager runs on the founder’s test desktop; sleep/standby/offline will drop the tunnel and make `F99669-C` appear offline.

**Why this matters**:
- Prevents wasted time chasing “facility offline” issues that are simply the test desktop being asleep.

### [2026-01-07] — ✅ Phase 1C Complete: Commit creates FHIR Media in ALEX via Lightsail BFF (desktop + mobile)

**What changed**:
- ✅ **Lightsail BFF**: Added real endpoint `POST /api/medtech/session/commit` (static IP) that creates FHIR `Media` in ALEX UAT using:
  - Mandatory `Media.identifier` with system `https://clinicpro.co.nz/image-id` and UUID value
  - `content.data` base64 (no S3 URL references)
  - Per-file size enforcement: `< 1MB`
  - Accepts source either `{ base64Data }` or `{ downloadUrl }` (BFF fetches `downloadUrl` then base64-encodes)
- ✅ **Vercel (Next.js)**: `POST /api/medtech/attachments/commit` now proxies to BFF only (no direct ALEX calls)
  - Requires `patientId` in request
  - For mobile images, presigns `s3Key` to a `downloadUrl` via existing `s3ImageService`
- ✅ **Widget**: Commit sends commit-ready sources
  - Desktop: converts `File` to `base64Data`
  - Mobile: sends `s3Key`
  - Always includes `patientId` in commit request

**Key constraints honoured**:
- Only Lightsail BFF calls ALEX (static IP); Vercel does not call ALEX anymore
- Size check enforced in BFF before POST (max 1MB)

**What was tested (evidence)**:
- **Direct BFF smoke test**:
  - `POST https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/api/medtech/session/commit` returned `status: committed`
  - Example `mediaId`: `a4fcaddd4b8f24f377eca1c6b889ad76`
- **Widget UAT (via Vercel logs)**:
  - `[Medtech Commit] Commit complete { duration: 3330, successCount: 2, errorCount: 0 }`
  - `POST /api/medtech/attachments/commit` returned `200` with `successCount: 2, errorCount: 0`
  - Session images endpoint returned `withDownloadUrls: 2`
  - UI shows green tick (committed) on thumbnails
- **Health checks (run from Windows)**:
  - `GET https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/health` OK
  - `GET https://api.clinicpro.co.nz/api/medtech/test?nhi=ZZZ0016` success
- **Test widget URL used**:
  - `https://www.clinicpro.co.nz/medtech-images?encounterId=test-enc-001&patientId=14e52e16edb7a435bfa05e307afd008b&facilityId=F2N060-E`

### [2026-01-06] — 🆕 Task Completion Checker Feature Exploration Started

**New Feature Concept** (validated as technically feasible):
- AI-powered tool to extract tasks from consultation notes and flag incomplete ones
- Approach: Hybrid (AI extracts, GP confirms, tool cross-references with ALEX data)
- Focus: Labs, Prescriptions, Referrals (verifiable via ALEX API)
- Note format: SOAP structure with Plan section, free text

**What Was Created**:
- BFF test endpoints: 5 new endpoints in `/lightsail-bff/index.js`
- Validation script: `/scripts/validate-task-checker-via-bff.ts` (via BFF) and `/scripts/validate-task-checker-api.ts` (direct; needs creds)

**Next Steps**:
1. Deploy BFF with new endpoints (merge to main)
2. Run validation script to confirm note text is accessible
3. If feasible, proceed to AI prompt design and MVP

**Documentation**:
- Background overview (archived snapshot): `archive/2026-01-07-consolidation/features/task-completion-checker/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md`
- UX decision (current): `features/task-completion-checker/UX_DECISION.md`

### [2026-01-08] — Task Completion Checker UX direction documented (Claude.ai); reassess after ALEX READ unblocked

**Decision**:
- Preferred UX is **passive background checking** with a dedicated Task Checker surface (tab) and queue-based processing; designed to be non-interrupting during consults.

**Blockers**:
- ALEX READ currently returns 403 for required resources (DocumentReference, DiagnosticReport, MedicationRequest, Communication, Task); waiting on Medtech to grant read permissions.
- Passive triggers depend on Medtech host capabilities (patient context change detection and/or supported surface for badge/tab); treat as pending until confirmed.

**Reassess point**:
- Once ALEX READ is granted and note text is retrievable, rerun `/scripts/validate-task-checker-via-bff.ts` and then reassess feasibility, latency, and extraction accuracy before implementing MVP.
### [2026-01-06] — ✅ Phase 1B Testing Complete & Production Ready
