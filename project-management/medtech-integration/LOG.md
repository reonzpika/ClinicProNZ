# Project Log - Medtech ALEX Integration

## 2026-01-10 Fri
### Milestone: Start project-based logging
- Logging has moved to per-project `LOG.md` files.
- Legacy history remains in `CHANGELOG.md` (pre-migration); new entries should go here going forward.

### Progress
- No new work recorded today.

### Decisions
- None.

### Blockers encountered
- Waiting on Medtech to clarify ALEX UAT search authorisation behaviour for non-Patient resources.
- Phase 1D UI validation still requires local facility `F99669-C` to be online (Windows desktop tunnel must stay awake).
