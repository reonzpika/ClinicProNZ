# Project Management AI SaaS

## Project Overview

**Vision**: An AI advisor and organizational system for first-time founders drowning in information. Cuts through the noise, provides structure, and tells you exactly what to do next—so you stop researching and start building.

**Tagline**: Stop drowning in startup advice. Get clear next steps.

**One-Liner**: The AI co-founder that turns information overload into focused action—for solo founders building their first startup.

**Current Stage**: Build - Working prototype operational, being dogfooded

**Stage Transition**: Moved from Validation → Build (2025-11-09) as working prototype is now complete and in active use

**MVP Strategy** (FOCUSED):
- **Target**: Startups only (founders, indie hackers, small startup teams)
- **Core**: SaaS version of our current project management system
- **AI**: ChatGPT API for conversational guidance and context-aware assistance
- **Scope**: No third-party integrations for MVP (Slack, GitHub, etc.)
- **Timeline**: Ship testable MVP in 2-4 weeks

## Core Concept

**"AI co-founder for solo founders"** — An AI-powered system that turns information overload into clear action. Combines battle-tested startup frameworks with conversational AI that understands where you are and tells you what to do next.

**The Problem We're Solving**: New founders read 100 articles, watch 50 videos, buy courses... then freeze. Too much information, no clear next step. They need a system + guidance, not another tool.

**Our Solution**: AI that cuts through noise + templates that provide structure + conversational interface that feels like talking to an experienced co-founder.

**What We're Building (MVP)**:
1. **Template-Driven Project Setup**: Like our current system (Idea Validation, Product Development, Business Planning templates)
2. **Conversational AI**: ChatGPT integration for project guidance, task generation, and context-aware advice
3. **Living Documentation**: PROJECT_SUMMARY.md concept as web interface (not markdown files)
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual dashboard showing project stage, milestones, blockers
5. **AI Advisor**: Brutally honest feedback on project decisions and priorities

**MVP Scope - What's IN**:
- ✅ Project creation with template selection (auto-selected based on description)
- ✅ Conversational AI for project setup and guidance
- ✅ Document management (goals, decisions, milestones, blockers)
- ✅ Project stage tracking (Ideation → Validation → Build → Operational)
- ✅ AI-generated insights and recommendations
- ✅ Simple task/milestone tracking
- ✅ Project dashboard (single view of project status)

**MVP Scope - What's OUT** (v2+):
- ❌ Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, Notion, etc.)
- ❌ Real-time collaboration (multiplayer editing)
- ❌ Advanced permissions/team features
- ❌ Mobile apps (web-responsive only)
- ❌ Multiple target audiences (only startups for MVP)
- ❌ API access for external tools
- ❌ Custom templates (use our predefined templates only)

## Progress [2025-11-09]

### Major Milestone: Working Prototype Complete 🎉
- ✅ **Modular rule system implemented**: 15 files, clean architecture, context-aware loading
- ✅ **Autonomous updates system created**: 523-line conversational AI engine that extracts trackable info from natural conversation  
- ✅ **Conversation-driven workflow**: Complete paradigm shift from command-driven to conversation-driven
- ✅ **Communication fundamentals**: Now always-loaded for consistent behavior from first message
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**: 4 guides created (AUTONOMOUS_SYSTEM.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, TEST_PLAN.md, README.md)

### Technical Achievement
- **System stats**: 843 lines always-loaded (~4,200 tokens), 7 core files, autonomous behavior
- **Architecture**: Modular, maintainable, scalable
- **Status**: Production-ready, currently being dogfooded

### Dogfooding Started
- Using the system for its own development (meta!)
- Every insight from usage = product learning  
- Every pain point = user pain point to solve
- Every delight = feature to amplify in SaaS

## Goals [Updated 2025-11-06]

**MVP Goal**: Ship a working AI advisor system for first-time founders in 2-4 weeks and get it in front of 10 solo founders drowning in information.

**Success Criteria**:
1. 10 first-time founders sign up and create projects
2. 5+ founders say "This reduced my overwhelm and gave me clarity"
3. 3+ founders say "I'd pay $20-30/month for this"
4. Founders actually complete the AI-guided setup (not abandon halfway)
5. Users ask "What should I do next?" and get actionable answers (not generic advice)

**Post-MVP Goals**:
- Iterate based on user feedback
- Add features users actually request (not what we assume)
- Expand to other audiences IF startups validate
- Build paid tier when usage justifies it

## Target Audience - Solo Founders & Side-Hustlers [2025-11-06]

**MVP Target**: Solo founders and side-hustlers who are NEW to building startups

### Who This Is For (Specific):
- **First-time founders** building their first startup (no prior startup experience)
- **Side-hustlers** building products while working a day job
- **Solo founders** (no co-founder yet, doing everything themselves)
- **Career-switchers** transitioning from corporate/employment to entrepreneurship
- **Aspiring indie hackers** who have ideas but don't know where to start

### What Defines This Audience:
- ✅ **New to the field** (0-2 years startup experience)
- ✅ **Working alone** (solo founder or very small team)
- ✅ **Information overload** (too many resources, unclear priorities)
- ✅ **Paralysis** (knows they should plan, doesn't know how)
- ✅ **Fragmented workflow** (notes everywhere, no system)
- ✅ **Seeking structure** (wants framework but not complex PM tools)

### Pain Points We're Solving (For New Solo Founders):

**1. Information Overload & Paralysis**
   - "I've read 50 articles, watched 20 YouTube videos, bought 3 courses... now what?"
   - Too many frameworks, conflicting advice, analysis paralysis
   - Can't separate signal from noise
   - Feels like drowning in information but no clarity

**2. Don't Know What to Do Next**
   - "I have an idea... what's my actual next step?"
   - No clear roadmap from idea → validation → MVP → launch
   - Existing advice is too generic or too enterprise-focused
   - Wasting weeks researching instead of building

**3. Fragmented Notes & Lost Ideas**
   - Notes scattered across: iPhone notes, Google Docs, Notion, random notebooks
   - Can't remember where you wrote that important insight
   - Revisiting old notes feels like starting from scratch
   - No system to organize thoughts and decisions

**4. No Structure or Framework**
   - "Should I validate first or just build?"
   - Don't know what milestones to aim for
   - No sense of progress (feels like spinning wheels)
   - Existing PM tools (Asana, Linear) are overkill and confusing

**5. Working in Isolation**
   - No co-founder or team to bounce ideas off
   - No one to challenge assumptions or provide feedback
   - Second-guessing every decision
   - Need guidance but can't afford a consultant/advisor

**6. Making It Up As You Go**
   - No playbook or template for what to do
   - Constantly wondering "Am I doing this right?"
   - Fear of missing critical steps (legal, validation, tech choices)
   - Wish someone would just tell you the order of operations

### How Our System Solves This:

**For Information Overload:**
- AI filters noise and gives you ONLY what matters for your current stage
- "I have an idea" → AI asks 5 key questions → generates focused action plan
- No generic advice - context-aware guidance based on YOUR project

**For "What Do I Do Next?"**
- Template-driven roadmap (Idea Validation → Product Dev → Launch)
- AI breaks down big goals into small, actionable next steps
- Clear milestones so you know if you're making progress

**For Fragmented Notes:**
- Single place for ALL project info (goals, decisions, tasks, learnings)
- Conversational interface - dump thoughts, AI organizes them
- Never lose context - AI maintains project history

**For Lack of Structure:**
- Pre-built templates for common startup journeys
- Stage-based guidance (Ideation vs. Validation vs. Build = different advice)
- Proven frameworks so you're not making it up

**For Working Alone:**
- AI acts as thinking partner and advisor
- Challenges your assumptions (brutally honest feedback)
- Asks the hard questions a co-founder would ask

**For Making It Up:**
- Playbook built-in (based on proven startup methodologies)
- AI knows the "order of operations" for startups
- Reduces anxiety - you're following a tested path

## Competitive Landscape [2025-11-06]

### Direct and Adjacent Competitors

**1. Guru (getguru.com)**
- **What they do**: Knowledge management for teams, Slack/Teams integration
- **Target**: Enterprise teams (10-1000+ employees)
- **Pricing**: $10-15/user/month (enterprise-focused)
- **Why we're different**:
  - ❌ Built for teams, not solo founders
  - ❌ Knowledge base for existing companies, not startup guidance
  - ❌ No template-driven startup frameworks
  - ❌ No "what should I do next" advisor
- **Threat level**: LOW (different market entirely)

**2. Frederick AI (frederick.ai)**
- **What they do**: AI business consultant, answers business questions, creates plans
- **Target**: Small businesses and entrepreneurs
- **Pricing**: Unknown (consultation/SaaS hybrid)
- **Why we're different**:
  - ✅ Similar concept (AI advisor for business)
  - ❌ Generic business consultant, not startup-specific
  - ❌ No ongoing project/task tracking system
  - ❌ No template-driven frameworks
  - ❌ Q&A focused, not continuous project context
- **Threat level**: MEDIUM (similar concept, different execution)
- **Our advantages**:
  - Ongoing project tracking + advice (not just one-off questions)
  - Startup-specific templates and frameworks
  - Decision/task logging over time
  - Single place for all project info
  - Focus on first-time founders with info overload

**3. Pitchbob (pitchbob.io)**
- **What they do**: AI for pitch decks, business plans, startup documents
- **Target**: Startups raising funding
- **Pricing**: ~$20-50/month (document generation)
- **Why we're different**:
  - ❌ Document generation tool, not project management
  - ❌ Focused on pitch decks/fundraising only
  - ❌ One-time creation, not ongoing guidance
  - ❌ No "what should I work on next" functionality
- **Threat level**: LOW (complementary, not competitive)
- **Partnership opportunity**: We tell founders "create pitch deck" → they use Pitchbob

**Traditional PM Tools (Asana, ClickUp, Monday, Notion)**
- **Why they're not competitors for our niche**:
  - Too complex for first-time founders
  - Built for teams/enterprises, not solo founders
  - Blank canvas = more overwhelm (especially Notion)
  - No startup-specific guidance or templates
  - No AI advisor that tells you what to do next

### Our Unique Position

**No one is combining**:
- ✅ Template-driven startup frameworks
- ✅ Ongoing project tracking + AI guidance
- ✅ "What do I do next" for overwhelmed beginners
- ✅ Single place for goals, decisions, tasks, milestones
- ✅ Brutally honest AI advisor (not generic consultant)
- ✅ Hyper-focus on first-time founders with info overload

**Market Gap**: Existing tools either:
- Offer AI consulting without project tracking (Frederick)
- Offer project management without startup-specific guidance (Asana, Notion)
- Solve specific problems without ongoing support (Pitchbob)

**We're the only tool that combines AI co-founder guidance + project organization + startup frameworks specifically for overwhelmed first-time founders.**

### Market Opportunity
- **Global startups**: 305M (our original research)
- **First-time founders**: ~60-70% of startups (estimated 180-210M first-time founders)
- **Solo founders**: ~40% of startups are solo-founded (120M+ potential users)
- **Target addressable**: First-time solo founders/side-hustlers experiencing info overload
- **Validation needed**: Talk to 10-20 target users to confirm pain point severity and willingness to pay

## Technology Stack - MVP [2025-11-06]

**Decision Made**: Keep it simple. Ship fast. Optimize later.

### MVP Tech Stack (LOCKED IN)

**Frontend**:
- **Next.js 14** (React + TypeScript) - Full-stack framework with API routes
- **Tailwind CSS** - Fast styling without design overhead
- **Shadcn/ui** - Pre-built components (don't build everything from scratch)
- **Server-side rendering** for better performance and SEO

**Backend**:
- **Next.js API Routes** - No separate backend needed for MVP
- **tRPC** (optional) - Type-safe API calls if needed
- **RESTful endpoints** for simplicity

**Database**:
- **PostgreSQL** (via Vercel Postgres or Supabase) - Single database for everything
- **Prisma ORM** - Type-safe database access, easy migrations
- Store documents as JSON in PostgreSQL (no MongoDB needed for MVP)

**Authentication**:
- **Clerk** or **NextAuth.js** - Drop-in auth solution (don't build from scratch)
- Social login (Google, GitHub) + email/password

**AI Integration**:
- **OpenAI ChatGPT API** (GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo) - You already have access
- Direct API calls, no abstraction layer for MVP
- Store conversation history in PostgreSQL

**Hosting**:
- **Vercel** - Deploy with one click, automatic scaling, edge functions
- **Vercel Postgres** - Database included, no separate DB hosting needed

**Why These Choices**:
1. **Next.js**: Everything in one framework (frontend + backend + deployment)
2. **PostgreSQL**: One database for everything (simpler than hybrid approach)
3. **Vercel**: Zero DevOps, focus on product, free tier for development
4. **Clerk/NextAuth**: Auth is hard, use proven solutions
5. **No microservices**: Monolith for MVP (easier to build and debug)

**What We're NOT Using for MVP**:
- ❌ Separate backend (Node.js/FastAPI) - Next.js API routes sufficient
- ❌ MongoDB/Elasticsearch - PostgreSQL JSON columns are fine for MVP
- ❌ Redis - No caching needed yet
- ❌ WebSockets/Socket.io - No real-time collaboration for MVP
- ❌ Docker/Kubernetes - Vercel handles deployment
- ❌ CDN - Vercel includes edge network

### AI Integration - ChatGPT [2025-11-06]

**Model**: OpenAI GPT-4-turbo (or GPT-3.5-turbo for cost optimization)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Direct API calls via OpenAI SDK
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Store conversation context in PostgreSQL
// Pass project context + conversation history to each API call
// Stream responses for better UX
```

**Key Features Powered by AI** (MVP):
1. **Conversational Project Setup**: "I want to build a SaaS tool" → AI asks clarifying questions → generates project structure
2. **Context-Aware Guidance**: "What should I work on next?" → AI considers project stage, goals, blockers → provides prioritized recommendations
3. **Brutally Honest Advisor**: AI challenges assumptions and exposes blind spots (like our AI character rules)
4. **Decision Logging**: AI extracts and logs key decisions from conversations automatically
5. **Milestone Generation**: Based on project type and stage, AI suggests relevant milestones
6. **Task Extraction**: AI identifies action items from free-form text and creates tasks

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:
- System prompt includes: project context, stage, goals, decisions, blockers
- AI character persona: brutally honest advisor (reference our current system's AI character)
- Context management: Include last N messages + full project summary
- Function calling: For creating tasks, updating project status, logging decisions

**Cost Management**:
- GPT-3.5-turbo for simple queries (~$0.001/1K tokens)
- GPT-4-turbo for complex advice/analysis (~$0.01/1K tokens)
- Estimated cost: $10-30/month for 10 active users during testing

## Project Structure

This project structure adapts to SaaS project needs, combining elements from Idea Validation, Business Planning, and Product Development templates.

### Folder Structure Rationale
- **01-idea-validation/**: Market research, competitor analysis, customer discovery
- **02-business-planning/**: Business model, pricing, revenue streams, financial projections
- **03-product-development/**: Roadmap, tech stack, architecture, features, MVP planning
- **04-technical/**: Architecture, API specs, infrastructure, deployment
- **05-marketing/**: Go-to-market strategy, positioning, customer acquisition (for future commercialization)

This structure supports the "MVP → validation → commercialization" strategy.

-- Milestones
Milestone { id, project_id, title, description, target_date, status }
```

## Key Decisions Made

### [2025-11-09] System Architecture: Conversation-Driven Not Command-Driven

**Decision**: Users shouldn't need to instruct AI to manage project management. They just talk naturally about their project, AI extracts trackable info and updates files autonomously in background. Documentation becomes a byproduct of conversation, not a separate activity.

**Rationale**: 
- Removes major friction point (users hate documenting)
- Makes system feel intelligent, not robotic
- Enables natural conversation flow
- This is the core innovation that separates us from traditional PM tools

**Impact**: 
- Complete workflow transformation
- User never manually edits PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- User never says "update the project"
- AI provides session summaries showing what was documented
- **This is the killer feature of the product**

**Implementation**: Created autonomous-updates.mdc (523 lines) with 9 conversational triggers

---

### [2025-11-09] Communication Fundamentals Always-Loaded

**Decision**: Communication quality (style, NZ localization, user intent understanding) should be foundational and consistent from first message, not optional/selective.

**Rationale**: These are table stakes, not features. Users shouldn't need to "activate" good UX. Consistency matters more than micro-optimizing tokens.

**Impact**:
- Always-loaded increased from 153 lines → 843 lines (~4,200 tokens)
- Consistent communication throughout every session
- User intent understanding applied universally
- Worth the token cost for quality experience

**Implementation**: Moved 3 communication files to core/ (always-loaded)

---

### [2025-11-09] Modular Architecture Over Monolithic

**Decision**: Split 5 monolithic files (722 lines) into 15 modular files for better maintainability, context-aware loading, and scalability.

**Rationale**: 
- Easier to maintain (single responsibility per file)
- Better token efficiency (context-aware loading)
- Scalable (easy to add new rules)
- No circular dependencies

**Impact**: Clean architecture, file-scoped auto-loading, clear hierarchy

**Implementation**: Created organized structure: core/, communication/, project-management/, technical/

---

### [2025-11-06] Original Planning Decisions

**✅ Locked In**:
- **Target Audience**: Solo founders & side-hustlers (first-time founders, 0-2 years experience, info overload)
- **Core Problem**: Information overload → analysis paralysis → "what do I do next?"
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL + Prisma + ChatGPT API + Vercel
- **MVP Scope**: No third-party integrations, single-user only, web-only (no native apps)
- **Timeline**: 4 weeks to ship MVP to 10 users
- **Core Features**: AI conversational setup, template-driven projects, decision/task tracking
- **Success Metric**: 3+ founders willing to pay $20-30/month after testing
- **Positioning**: "AI co-founder that turns information overload into clear next steps"

**❌ Deferred to Post-MVP**:
- Small businesses and GP practices as target audiences
- Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, Notion)
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Mobile native apps
- Custom templates

## Session Insights & Learnings

### [2025-11-09] Major Learnings from Implementation

**1. The Rule System IS the Product**

Insight: The Cursor AI rule system we built isn't just infrastructure—it's the actual SaaS product prototype. We're dogfooding our own product right now.

What This Means:
- Technical feasibility: Proven (it works)
- User experience: Validated (we're using it)
- Value proposition: Clear (saves documentation effort)
- Every usage insight = product requirement

Action: Continue dogfooding, document all pain points and delights

---

**2. Documentation as Byproduct Is the Innovation**

Insight: Traditional PM tools make documentation a separate activity (chore). Our innovation is making documentation a byproduct of conversation (automatic).

Why This Matters:
- Removes major friction point
- Users hate documenting (we just eliminated that)
- Reframes the category (not a tool, a thought partner)
- Competitive advantage (industry first)

Validation: We just had a 2-hour session about the system, and it documented itself autonomously (this update you're reading!)

---

**3. Communication Quality Is Foundational Not Optional**

Insight: User (you!) pointed out that communication style, localization, and user intent understanding should ALWAYS be active, not on-demand. These are foundational behaviors, not features.

Why This Matters:
- Consistency matters more than micro-optimizing tokens
- Users shouldn't need to "activate" good UX
- Quality should be table stakes
- Worth the token cost

Action: Moved communication fundamentals to always-loaded

---

**4. Autonomous > Reactive**

Insight: System should listen and act proactively, not wait for explicit commands. AI should infer intent and update automatically.

Why This Matters:
- Reduces user cognitive load
- Makes system feel intelligent, not robotic
- Enables natural conversation flow  
- This is what separates AI from traditional software

Action: Implemented 9 conversational triggers for autonomous updates

---

### [2025-11-06] Original Session Learnings

**Evolution of Target Audience** (How we got here):
1. **Started**: "Startups, small businesses, and GP practices" (too broad, 3 different markets)
2. **Refined**: "Startups only" (better focus, but still vague)
3. **Considered pivot**: "NZ small businesses" (chasing TAM without validation - rejected)
4. **Final**: "Solo founders & side-hustlers struggling with info overload" (specific, reachable, validated problem)

**Key Lessons Learned**:

1. **Market Size ≠ Opportunity**
   - Almost pivoted to NZ small businesses (546K vs 2.4K startups = 227x bigger market)
   - Realized: Bigger TAM with no fit < Perfect fit with smaller market
   - Small businesses have different problems (operations vs. strategy)
   - Our templates/product don't map to small business needs
   - **Lesson**: Validate problem-solution fit before chasing TAM

2. **Analysis Paralysis in Action**
   - Progression: Business proposal → refine target → tech stack → validate market → positioning → **competitors**
   - Each step = "just one more thing" before building
   - Spotted the pattern: User experiencing the exact problem they're solving
   - **Lesson**: Time-box research (15 min max), then BUILD. Action > endless planning.

3. **User = Target Audience**
   - Building for "solo founders with info overload"
   - User (me) IS experiencing info overload and analysis paralysis
   - This creates unique empathy AND validation (if I struggle with X, so will users)
   - Can be first user ("eat your own dog food")
   - **Lesson**: Your pain points = product validation when you ARE the target user

4. **Specificity Wins**
   - "Startups" → too vague, hard to reach, unclear pain points
   - "Solo founders NEW to startups struggling with info overload" → specific, reachable, clear problem
   - Specific niche = easier to find users (r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, Indie Hackers)
   - Specific problem = clearer value prop and messaging
   - **Lesson**: Niche down until you can clearly articulate who has the problem and where to find them

5. **Competitors Validate Market**
   - Found 3 competitors: Guru (teams), Frederick AI (generic consultant), Pitchbob (pitch decks)
   - None do exactly what we're building (AI co-founder + project tracking + startup frameworks)
   - Competitors existing = market validation (people pay for AI business tools)
   - **Lesson**: Competitors are good (validate market). Differentiation matters more than being first.

6. **Time-Boxing Research**
   - Could've spent days analyzing competitors
   - Instead: 15 minutes, quick analysis, move on
   - Research has diminishing returns (80% value in first 15-20 minutes)
   - **Lesson**: Set time limits on research activities. Good enough > perfect for MVP stage.

7. **Validation Before Pivot**
   - Almost pivoted to small businesses without talking to ANY small business owners
   - Would've wasted 4 weeks building for wrong audience
   - **Lesson**: Never pivot without talking to 5-10 people from new target audience first

**AI Character Improvements Made**:
- Added "Recognizing and Stopping Analysis Paralysis" section
- Added rules for calling out "just one more thing" pattern
- Added validation-first rules (require user conversations before pivots)
- Added user context section (users are often solo founders experiencing same problems)
- Added time-boxing rules for research activities
- Added accountability tracking (reference user's commitments and timelines)

**Irony Recognized**:
- Building product to solve info overload for founders
- User experiencing info overload during product planning
- User exhibiting analysis paralysis while defining product that solves analysis paralysis
- **This validates the problem is REAL and common**

**What Worked in This Session**:
- ✅ Brutal honesty when user wanted to pivot without validation
- ✅ Calling out analysis paralysis pattern explicitly
- ✅ Time-boxing competitor research (15 min, here's summary, now BUILD)
- ✅ Showing opportunity cost ("Every hour researching = 0 progress on MVP")
- ✅ Forcing decisions (Option A or B, pick one)
- ✅ Challenging assumptions about market size = opportunity
- ✅ Pushing action over endless planning

**Next Session Should**:
- Reference these learnings when user exhibits same patterns
- Use user's own behavior as product validation
- Push for Week 1 execution (project setup + auth + deploy)
- Block any new "just one more thing" research requests

---

**Session Status**: Planning phase COMPLETE. Next session = START building (Week 1, Day 1).

**DO NOT in next session**:
- ❌ Research more competitors/market
- ❌ Refine target audience further
- ❌ Debate tech stack decisions
- ❌ Add features to MVP scope
- ❌ "Just one more thing" before starting

**DO in next session**:
- ✅ Initialize Next.js 14 project
- ✅ Set up database and Prisma
- ✅ Configure authentication
- ✅ Deploy to Vercel
- ✅ Complete Week 1 deliverables

---

## Next Immediate Actions

**Start Week 1 (Days 1-7)**:
1. Initialize Next.js 14 project with TypeScript + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui
2. Set up Vercel Postgres + Prisma ORM
3. Implement NextAuth.js authentication (Google/GitHub + email)
4. Deploy to Vercel and confirm everything works

**By End of Week 1**: Working app with auth, deployed and accessible.

## Project Management System Improvements [2025-11-08]

**Context**: This SaaS product is based on the project management system currently in use (this repository). Improvements made to the underlying system will inform the SaaS product design.

### Document Creation Timing Rule Added

**Problem Identified**: AI was creating too many interim/working documents during discussions and planning phases, cluttering the workspace and interrupting conversation flow.

**Solution Implemented**: Added "Document Creation Timing - CRITICAL RULE" to `.cursor/rules/master_rule.mdc`:

**When to CREATE Documents**:
- ✅ Task is accomplished/finished
- ✅ Future reference needed (reusable workflows, templates, configs)
- ✅ User explicitly requests document creation

**When NOT to Create Documents** (respond in chat instead):
- ❌ During discussion/exploration
- ❌ Planning/iterating on ideas
- ❌ Draft/work-in-progress content
- ❌ Interim steps in workflow

**Decision Framework**: Before creating any document, verify:
1. Is the task/work complete? → If NO, respond in chat
2. Does this need to be saved for future reference? → If NO, respond in chat
3. Did the user explicitly ask to save/create? → If NO, respond in chat
4. Is this a final deliverable? → If NO, respond in chat

**Default Behavior**: When in doubt, respond in chat. Only create documents when clearly needed for future reference or when work is complete.

**Impact on SaaS Product**: This rule will inform the SaaS product's document creation UX:
- Users should be able to iterate/discuss without creating permanent artifacts
- Only save/create documents when user explicitly requests or work is complete
- Provide "draft mode" vs "saved document" distinction
- Allow users to work in chat/conversation without forcing document creation

**Files Updated**:
- `.cursor/rules/master_rule.mdc` - Added Document Creation Timing section
- Updated Operational Loop to include document creation check as step 3
- Updated Quick Reference to include rule #4
