  - Specialist letters → problem list updates
  - Lab trending → clinical insights
  - Pharmacy dispensing data (if accessible)

**Clinical Validation & Safety**
- Track longitudinal intelligence accuracy through GP feedback
- Build correction/refinement loop (GPs edit AI summaries → model improves)
- Implement audit trails for safety/liability
- Measure: How often does longitudinal context change clinical decisions?

**Regulatory Strategy**
- Select ONE clinical pathway for validation:
  - Candidates: Hypertension follow-up, diabetes monitoring, anticoagulation management
  - Criteria: High-volume, evidence-based, measurable outcomes
- Begin regulatory scoping (Medsafe consultation)
- Design clinical trial or real-world evidence study

**Business Model Refinement**
- Shift pitch from "AI tool" to "patient intelligence infrastructure"
- Target PHO or Te Whatu Ora pilot (population health use case)
- Explore insurance partnerships (risk reduction value proposition)

### Exit Criteria (Month 42)
- ✅ Longitudinal patient intelligence demonstrably reduces diagnostic errors or missed follow-ups
- ✅ Data corpus includes 100K+ patient interactions with outcome tracking
- ✅ Regulatory pathway scoped for one clinical domain
- ✅ PHO or payer pilot agreement signed
- ✅ Switching costs becoming significant (practices can't easily leave)

### Key Deliverables

**Proactive Population Management**
- **Panel-Level Intelligence**:
  - Identify patients overdue for chronic disease reviews
  - Surface deteriorating trends before they become acute
  - Risk stratification (which patients need outreach?)
  - Generate outreach lists with pre-drafted messages
  
- **Care Coordination Workflows**:
  - Multi-step care episodes (discharge → GP review → specialist follow-up)

## Phase 5: Strategic Optionality (Year 5+)

### **Objective**: Capitalise on accumulated assets; choose optimal long-term path

### Option A: Exit (Acquisition)
**Potential Acquirers**:
- **Medtech** (integrate as premium tier, eliminate competitor)
- **Health insurer** (Southern Cross, nib) - risk management infrastructure
- **Te Whatu Ora** (absorb as national infrastructure)
- **International consolidator** (Salesforce Health, Oracle Health, etc.)

**Exit Value Drivers**:
- Active user base (150+ practices)
- Proprietary longitudinal outcome data
- Regulatory approvals (moat)
- Demonstrated ROI evidence
- PMS-agnostic architecture (portability)

---

### Option B: Independent Infrastructure Business
**Continue building toward**:
- Multi-organisational care coordination (hospital ↔ GP ↔ specialist)
- Population health analytics platform
- Outcome tracking infrastructure for value-based contracts
- White-label AI engine licensed to other health systems

**Path to sustainability**:
- Outcome-based contracts with payers
- Platform licensing fees from PHOs/health systems
- Regulatory approval licensing (other countries adopt validated pathways)

---

### Option C: International Expansion
**Target Markets** (in order):
1. **Australia** (similar systems, close regulatory alignment)
2. **UK** (NHS workflows nearly identical to NZ)
3. **Scandinavia** (single-payer, outcome-focused)
4. **Canada** (provincial health systems, high GP burnout)

**NZ becomes proof-of-concept** → export validated playbook

## Critical Success Factors (Across All Phases)

### **1. Clinical Credibility**
- You must remain clinically active (maintain GP practice)
- Peer validation > marketing claims
- Every feature validated in real clinical context
- Safety incidents = existential threat (design obsessively for safety)

### **2. Capital Efficiency**
- Stay grant-funded + revenue-generating as long as possible
- Avoid VC dependency (misaligned timelines)
- Each phase must be self-funding or grant-funded
- Only raise capital if it unlocks clear strategic advantage

### **3. Outcome Evidence**
- Continuously generate publishable evidence
- Track metrics payers care about (time, cost, quality, safety)
- Build case studies from real practices
- Academic partnerships for credibility (University of Auckland, Otago)

### **4. Strategic Patience**
- Resist pressure to chase features or revenue spikes
- Focus on defensibility over growth rate
- Each phase builds moat depth, not just user count
- Saying "no" to distractions is competitive advantage

### **5. Regulatory Timing**
- Don't chase regulatory approval too early (expensive distraction)
- Do pursue it strategically once you have capital and evidence
- Regulatory moat is real but timing is everything

## Key Risks & Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|---------|---------------|
| **Medtech copies Inbox AI** | Move faster up the stack; build what they won't (longitudinal intelligence, regulatory pathways) |
| **Slow GP adoption** | Start with peer network; prove value in your own practice first; clinical credibility |
| **PMS API restrictions** | PMS-agnostic architecture already in place; maintain adapter layer flexibility |
| **Capital starvation** | R&D grants + early revenue; stay lean; avoid VC dependency until strategic clarity |
| **Data quality problems** | GP feedback loops; correction mechanisms; start narrow (don't try to solve everything) |
| **Regulatory drag** | Selective pursuit (one pathway); delay until Phase 3–4; don't let it distract from product-market fit |
| **Founder burnout** | Phase work to maintain clinical practice; hire strategically; build sustainable pace |

---

## Milestone-Based Decision Points

### **End of Phase 1 (Month 12)**
**Decision**: Is Inbox AI working?
- If YES → Proceed to Phase 2
- If NO → Pivot or shut down

### **End of Phase 2 (Month 24)**
**Decision**: Are GPs retaining and expanding usage?
- If YES → Invest in data moat (Phase 3)
- If NO → Reassess product-market fit or exit early

### **End of Phase 3 (Month 42)**
**Decision**: Is data moat defensible? Are payers interested?
- If YES → Build platform (Phase 4)
- If NO → Consider acqui-hire exit or pivot to different buyer

### **End of Phase 4 (Month 60)**
**Decision**: Continue as infrastructure business or exit?
- Evaluate: Market position, competitive threats, capital requirements, founder goals
- Choose: Exit, scale, or international expansion

## Final Thoughts

This roadmap balances:
- **Speed** (move before competitors)
- **Depth** (build moats, not features)
- **Evidence** (what convinces buyers and funders)
- **Optionality** (multiple exit paths)
- **Reality** (achievable with limited capital)

You have a rare advantage: **clinical credibility + technical execution + strategic clarity**.

Most health tech founders have 1 of 3. You have all 3.

The roadmap works if you stay disciplined, capital-efficient, and focused on defensibility over vanity metrics.

**Now: What's your first milestone?**
