# LinkedIn Content Marketing Workflow

**Purpose**: Manual testing workflow for AI-curated medical news to build NZ GP audience on LinkedIn and drive traffic to GP Voices community.

**Status**: Deferred until after Medtech integration revenue is proven. Use this workflow when ready to test content marketing channel.

**Time Investment**: 1-2 hours per week (manual curation + posting)

---

## Weekly Workflow (30-60 minutes)

### Step 1: Curate News Items (15-20 minutes)

**Sources to Monitor**:
- **BPAC** (Best Practice Advocacy Centre): https://bpac.org.nz/ (NZ-specific clinical guidance)
- **NZ Doctor**: https://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/ (NZ medical news)
- **Health Quality & Safety Commission**: https://www.hqsc.govt.nz/ (Patient safety, quality updates)
- **Pharmac**: https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/ (Medication updates, funding decisions)
- **Ministry of Health**: https://www.health.govt.nz/ (Policy updates, public health)
- **Medical Council of NZ**: https://www.mcnz.org.nz/ (Regulatory updates)
- **RNZCGP**: https://www.rnzcgp.org.nz/ (College updates, CPD)

**Curation Criteria** (Pick 3-5 items):
- ✅ Relevant to NZ GPs (not international-only)
- ✅ Actionable or thought-provoking (not just news)
- ✅ Recent (within last 7 days)
- ✅ Clinical or practice management focused
- ✅ Avoid: Pure politics, controversial topics without clinical angle

**AI-Assisted Curation** (Optional - use ChatGPT/Claude):
```
Prompt: "I'm a GP in New Zealand. Curate 5 recent medical news items 
from NZ sources (BPAC, NZ Doctor, Pharmac, etc.) that would be most 
relevant and interesting to my GP colleagues. For each item, provide:
1. Source and headline
2. Why it matters to GPs (1-2 sentences)
3. Key takeaway (1 sentence)"
```

### Step 2: Create LinkedIn Post (10-15 minutes)

**Post Structure** (Choose one format):

**Format A: Single Item Deep Dive**
```
[Headline/Question Hook]

[2-3 sentences: What happened + why it matters to GPs]

[1-2 sentences: Clinical/practice implications]

[Call to action: "What's your experience with [topic]?" or 
"Join the discussion in GP Voices: [link]"]

#NZGP #GeneralPractice #NZHealthcare
```

**Format B: Weekly Roundup** (3-5 items)
```
📰 This Week in NZ General Practice

[Item 1: Headline + 1 sentence]
[Item 2: Headline + 1 sentence]
[Item 3: Headline + 1 sentence]

[1-2 sentences: Common theme or takeaway]

[Call to action: "What stood out to you this week?"]

#NZGP #GeneralPractice #NZHealthcare
```

**Format C: Clinical Case/Scenario**
```
[Clinical scenario/question]

[Brief context]

[Key learning point]

[Question: "How would you handle this?"]

#NZGP #ClinicalCases #GeneralPractice
```

**Best Practices**:
- ✅ Lead with value (what GPs will learn/gain)
- ✅ Use questions to encourage engagement
- ✅ Keep it concise (2-3 paragraphs max)
- ✅ Include relevant hashtags: #NZGP #GeneralPractice #NZHealthcare
- ✅ Tag GP Voices community when relevant: "Join the discussion in GP Voices: [link]"
- ✅ Post at optimal times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-9am or 5-6pm NZST

### Step 3: Engage with Comments (5-10 minutes)

**Within 2 hours of posting**:
- Respond to first 3-5 comments personally
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share additional insights
- Thank people for engaging

**Throughout the week**:
- Check notifications daily (5 minutes)
- Respond to comments within 24 hours
- Engage with other GP posts (like, comment thoughtfully)

### Step 4: Track Metrics (5 minutes)

**Track Weekly**:
- Post impressions
- Engagement rate (likes + comments / impressions)
- Profile views
- Link clicks (if linking to GP Voices)
- New connections/followers

**Success Indicators** (After 4 weeks):
- ✅ 50+ impressions per post
- ✅ 5%+ engagement rate
- ✅ 10+ profile views per week
- ✅ 2-3 comments per post
- ✅ Growing follower count

**If metrics are low**:
- Try different post formats
- Post at different times
- Adjust content topics
- If still low after 4 weeks → Pause and focus on Medtech integration

---

## Monthly Review (30 minutes)

**After 4 weeks of posting**:

1. **Analyze Performance**:
   - Which post formats worked best?
   - Which topics got most engagement?
   - What time of day performed best?
   - Did profile views increase?

2. **Decide Next Steps**:
   - **If working** (meeting success indicators):
     - Continue manual posting
     - Consider building automation tool
     - Scale to 2-3 posts per week
   - **If not working**:
     - Pause LinkedIn content
     - Focus on Medtech integration revenue
     - Revisit content strategy later

3. **Iterate**:
   - Double down on what worked
   - Stop what didn't work
   - Try new formats/topics

---

## Automation Ideas (For Later - After Manual Testing)

**If manual testing proves successful**, consider building:

1. **AI Curation Tool**:
   - RSS feed aggregator (BPAC, NZ Doctor, etc.)
   - ChatGPT API to summarize and curate
   - Filter by relevance to GPs
   - Generate post drafts

2. **Scheduling Tool**:
   - Buffer/Hootsuite for scheduling
   - Optimal posting times
   - Queue 3-5 posts per week

3. **Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Track LinkedIn metrics
   - A/B test post formats
   - Identify best-performing content

**Don't build automation until**:
- ✅ Manual posting works (4+ weeks of good metrics)
- ✅ You have proven revenue from Medtech integration
- ✅ You have time to invest in content marketing

**Next Review**: After Medtech integration revenue is proven

**Remember**: 
- Test manually first (4 weeks)
