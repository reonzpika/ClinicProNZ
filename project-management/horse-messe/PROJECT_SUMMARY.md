# Horse Messe

Owner: Yoko (Cloud Nine / Cloud Nine x Kurume Kasuri)
Support: You (ops, comms, coordination)
Event website: `https://horsemesse.jp/`
Primary objective (time-boxed): be **event-ready by 31 Jan 2026**.

## Outcome (definition of done)
- **Products ready**: price list finalised, inventory packed, signage and QR codes printed.
- **Customer capture ready**: Instagram profile live, Linktree updated, basic website live (or a clear reason why not).
- **Event-day payments ready**: card + contactless + cash plan tested, receipts process decided.
- **Ops ready**: packing list, setup plan, staff script, and contingency plan written.

## Current status
- Linktree created: `https://linktr.ee/cloudninejp` (links not populated yet)
- Pamphlet design created with QR code pointing to Linktree
- Products: in progress (Yoko primary focus)
- Website build: Yoko's friend is helping (scope and goals still need to be defined)

## Key decisions (must decide to unblock)
### D1. Website scope (default recommendation)
Pick one:
- **Option A (recommended, fastest)**: Portfolio-style landing page
  - What it includes: brand story, product gallery, prices (or price range), event details, Instagram link, contact form, and “custom orders” enquiry.
  - What it avoids: full e-commerce and shipping complexity before the event.
- Option B: E-commerce (sell online)
  - Requires: product catalogue, inventory tracking, payments, shipping policy, returns, legal pages, customer support workflow.

**Default until proven otherwise**: Option A. If Yoko explicitly wants online sales before event day, switch to Option B with a strict MVP (limited SKUs only).

### D2. Payment method on event day (default recommendation)
Default recommendation (Japan-friendly): **Square** (card + contactless) + cash.
Alternate: **PayPay** + cash (if already set up and preferred).

### D3. Customer capture
Default recommendation: **Instagram as the main channel**, with Linktree as the hub, and email/LINE for custom orders.

## Workstreams
### 1) Brand and assets
- Product photography (fast, consistent lighting, neutral background)
- Copy: brand story, materials, care instructions, “limited quantity”
- Price list (JPY), SKU naming convention, tags

### 2) Website and Linktree
- Decide website scope (A vs B)
- Provide a one-page website brief to the website builder
- Linktree links: Instagram, website, event location, “custom order” contact

### 3) Instagram (content pipeline)
- Profile: bio, highlights, pinned posts, link in bio (Linktree)
- Runway plan:
  - 12 feed posts by event day
  - 3–5 stories/week (daily stories in final week)
  - Content mix:
    - 2x brand trust
    - 5x product highlights (one product per post, include price or price range)
    - 2x behind-the-scenes
    - 2x event logistics
    - 1x credibility
- DM script for enquiries and custom orders

### 4) Event-day operations
- Payments setup + test transactions
- Receipts and bookkeeping workflow
- Packing list, booth layout, signage, price cards
- Inventory count sheet (start of day, end of day)
- Customer capture sheet (QR for follow, small incentive if possible)

## Timeline (end-of-Jan runway)
### Week of 16–19 Jan
- Confirm D1 website scope and D2 payments choice.
- Create inventory list + provisional pricing.
- Set up Instagram profile (if not already).

### Week of 20–26 Jan
- Website builder publishes website MVP (Option A); team connects it from Linktree.
- Populate Linktree with final links.
- Prepare booth materials (price cards, QR signage, packaging).
- Dry-run packing and payment flow.

### Week of 27–31 Jan
- Final content push on Instagram.
- Final inventory count and packing.
- Event-day checklist rehearsal.

## Risks and mitigations
- **Overbuilding website**: lock scope to Option A unless Yoko opts into e-commerce explicitly.
- **Payment setup delays**: pick one provider, complete KYC early, test a transaction.
- **Product photos not ready**: use consistent quick photos; upgrade later.

## Next actions (highest leverage)
- Decide D1 (website scope) and D2 (payment provider) this week.
- Draft a single-page website structure and gather minimum assets (logo, 8–12 photos, short copy).
