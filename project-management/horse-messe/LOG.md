# Horse Messe - Log

## 2026-01-16
- Created project scaffold in repo under `project-management/horse-messe/`.
- Captured current known status:
  - Linktree exists: `https://linktr.ee/cloudninejp` (links to be added later)
  - Pamphlet designed with QR pointing to Linktree
  - Products in progress; event readiness needs workstreams beyond product build
- Set default recommendations (pending confirmation):
  - Website: portfolio-style landing page (fast MVP) rather than full e-commerce before event day
  - Event-day payments: Square + cash (or PayPay if already preferred)
