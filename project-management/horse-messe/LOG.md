# Horse Messe - Log

## 2026-01-16
- Created project scaffold in repo under `project-management/horse-messe/`.
- Captured current known status:
  - Linktree exists: `https://linktr.ee/cloudninejp` (links to be added later)
  - Pamphlet designed with QR pointing to Linktree
  - Products in progress; event readiness needs workstreams beyond product build
- Set default recommendations (pending confirmation):
  - Website: portfolio-style landing page (fast MVP) rather than full e-commerce before event day
  - Event-day payments: Square + cash (or PayPay if already preferred)

## 2026-01-16 (later)
- Update: Yoko confirmed a friend will help build the website.
- Sent Yoko a simplified Google Form to clarify decisions (website goals, products, pricing, payments).
- Planning focus: Instagram runway to event day:
  - Target: 12 feed posts by event day
  - Mix: brand trust, product highlights, behind-the-scenes, event logistics, credibility
  - Stories: 3–5 per week; daily stories in final week
