# Week 2, 2026 (Jan 6-12)

## Daily Log

### Tuesday, Jan 6
- ✅ Phase 1B testing completed; production-ready (see Week 1 log post-week update).

### Wednesday, Jan 7
- ✅ Win: Fixed Lightsail BFF automated deployments; removed recurring `rsync` permission issue; improved reliability and diagnostics.
  - Staging now uses `/tmp/clinicpro-bff-staging-${SHA}` to avoid `/home/ubuntu` traversal (`0700`) issues.
  - Deploy runs `sudo -u deployer rsync` to `/home/deployer/app`, runs `npm ci --production --no-audit`, restarts `clinicpro-bff`, and verifies `systemctl is-active --quiet clinicpro-bff`.
  - Added better failure diagnostics (`systemctl status` and recent journal output).

### Thursday, Jan 8
- ✅ Customer-side launch prep:
  - Emailed Medtech requesting commercial terms (revenue share, fees, billing route, payment terms).
  - Emailed Intellimed requesting QuickShot pricing and inclusions.
  - Posted in NZ GP Facebook group asking how clinicians handle clinical photos and pain points (file size/resizing); invited DMs.
- ✅ Phase 1D READ permissions investigation (hosted facility `F2N060-E`):
  - Confirmed patient lookup works (`/FHIR/Patient` read succeeds).
  - Confirmed the OAuth token (client credentials) contains expected `roles[]`, including:
    - `patient.task.read`
    - `patient.media.read`
    - `patient.communication.generalcommunication.read`
    - `patient.communication.outboxwebform.read`
  - Direct ALEX calls from Lightsail show:
    - `GET /FHIR/metadata` returns `200`
    - `GET /FHIR/Patient/{id}` returns `200`
    - Any FHIR search on non-Patient resources returns `403` "Authorization failed", including:
      - `GET /FHIR/Task?_count=1`
      - `GET /FHIR/Communication?...` (patient and subject variants)
      - `GET /FHIR/Media?...` (patient and subject variants)
  - Restarted `clinicpro-bff` to force a fresh token; behaviour unchanged.
  - Emailed Medtech support with the setup and evidence, asking whether ALEX requires additional permissions/policy for FHIR search operations in UAT.
