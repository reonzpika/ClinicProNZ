# Weekly Logs

This folder contains weekly logs for tracking progress, decisions, and learnings.

## Structure

Each week has its own file: `2026-WXX.md`

Example: `2026-W01.md` (Week 1, 2026)

## What Goes in Weekly Logs

**During the week:**
- Daily accomplishments
- Decisions made
- Customer conversations
- Blockers encountered

**End of week (Friday):**
- Achievement check (hit the ONE big win?)
- Customer engagement count and insights
- Time allocation actual vs planned
- Metrics progress
- Learnings (what worked, what didn't)
- Next week's plan

## How to Use

1. **Create new log**: Copy template from Week 1 or use "weekly review" command with AI
2. **Update daily**: Quick notes about what happened (optional but helpful)
3. **Friday review**: Complete "End of Week Review" section (mandatory)
4. **AI integration**: AI reads current week's log to understand context

## Benefits

- Creates record of customer feedback (not lost in chat)
- Shows patterns over time (e.g., "said would contact GPs for 4 weeks straight")
- Tracks decisions with context (why did we decide X?)
- Accountability (can't claim "worked on customer outreach" if log shows 0 contacts)
- Learning repository (what experiments worked/failed)

## Tips

- Keep daily entries SHORT (3-5 bullet points max)
- Focus on customer insights (what did you learn?)
- Be honest about blockers (these inform strategy)
- Celebrate wins (first paying customer = huge milestone)
- Don't skip Friday review (this is where accountability happens)

*Start with Week 1 template and iterate from there.*
