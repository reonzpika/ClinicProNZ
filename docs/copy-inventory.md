| Section heading | Thank You for Stopping By | |
| Subheading | A Message from Dr. Ryo Eguchi | |
| Role line | Practising GP & Founder | |
| Blockquote para 1 | Like many GPs, I felt increasingly disconnected from why I became a doctor. The constant rush, endless admin, and pressure were taking their toll — on me and my patients. | |
| Blockquote para 2 | Then I discovered my ikigai: combining my medical expertise with my deep passion for AI and automation. ClinicPro was born from this vision — using smart technology to give GPs back their time, reduce burnout, and restore the joy in patient care. | |

### 3.8 FAQ
| Location | Copy | Review |
|----------|------|--------|
| H2 | Common Questions | |
| Q1 | How does this save me 30 minutes per referral? | |
| A1 | The old workflow—email photos to yourself, download, resize, re-upload—often takes 30+ minutes when things go wrong. With Referral Images you capture on your phone and photos appear on your desktop in 30 seconds, already compressed and ready to attach. No manual resize, no "file too large" rejections. | |
| Q2 | Does it work with HealthLink/Manawatū e-referral systems? | |
| A2 | Yes. You get a JPEG file on your desktop (or download from the desktop page). You attach that file to your e-referral in HealthLink, Manawatū, or any system that accepts image attachments. We don't integrate directly into your PMS; you use the file where you need it. | |
| Q3 | Is my patient data secure? | |
| A3 | Images are stored securely and automatically deleted after 24 hours. We don't use your images for training or share them with third parties. The service is built with NZ healthcare data standards in mind. For full details see our Privacy policy. | |
| Q4 | Why is it free? | |
| A4 | Because GPs deserve better tools. I built this for myself and my colleagues. The goal is to make clinical work easier, not to extract value from doctors. | |
| Q5 | How is this different from QuickShot/MedImage? | |
| A5 | Referral Images is focused on one thing: getting referral photos from your phone to your desktop in seconds, always as JPEG and under 500KB. No PDFs, no extra steps. If you use Medtech Evolution we're building deeper integration; for other systems you use the download and attach workflow. | |
| Q6 | Do I need to install anything? | |
| A6 | No. You sign up, get a desktop link and a mobile link (save the mobile link to your home screen for one-tap access). Use your browser on desktop and your browser on phone. No app store install required. | |

## Consistency notes (for review)

- **practising vs practicing**: AI Scribe landing uses "practising" (NZ) in hero/final CTA and "practicing" in footer; Referral-images landing footer "practicing". Consider standardising on NZ spelling.
- **Referral Images vs referral images**: Product name capitalisation in headings vs body.
- **>10 vs >1/2**: Both used; ensure tone is consistent where you cite time saved.
