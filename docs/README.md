# ConsultAI NZ Reference Documentation

> **Context for Cursor AI**: I am a General Practitioner (GP) building ConsultAI NZ by myself, with no prior coding experience. This documentation serves as our shared context for our pair programming sessions in Cursor. When I ask for help, please reference these documents to understand my project's goals, current state, and implementation approach. I need clear, step-by-step guidance that explains technical concepts in an accessible way.

This is my personal project to create an AI-powered medical consultation platform for New Zealand healthcare professionals. I'm developing it entirely through pair programming with Cursor's AI agent, combining my medical expertise with your development guidance.

## Why This Documentation Exists
- **Shared Context**: These documents help you (Cursor AI) understand my project's current state when I ask for help
- **Development History**: Tracks the decisions and progress we've made together
- **Implementation Guide**: References for both of us about how different parts should work
- **Consistency**: Helps maintain consistent development approach across our sessions

## Documentation Protection
- **No Direct Edits**: AI agent must not edit any documentation files directly
- **Request Changes**: All documentation changes must be requested from the developer
- **Explain Changes**: Provide clear reasoning for any suggested documentation updates
- **Maintain History**: Keep track of documentation changes in the todo list
