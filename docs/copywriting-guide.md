# ClinicPro Copywriting Guide

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** February 2026  
**Purpose:** Master reference for all ClinicPro copy - website, emails, app UI

---

## 1. Brand Voice & Tone

### Core Principles
- **Personal, not corporate**: This is Dr. Ryo speaking directly to fellow GPs
- **Conversational**: Like talking to a colleague at the tea room, not writing a medical journal
- **Honest and transparent**: No marketing fluff, no exaggeration, no BS
- **Humble confidence**: "I built this for myself, might work for you" vs "Revolutionary game-changer"
- **Practical**: Focus on real workflow problems, not abstract benefits

### Voice Characteristics
✅ **DO:**
- Use first person: "I built this", "I use it daily"
- Be direct and clear
- Acknowledge limitations: "still need your review", "still in beta"
- Use casual contractions: "it's", "you're", "that's"
- Address GPs as equals, not customers

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use corporate "we" (except in team contexts)
- Overpromise or hype
- Use jargon unless clinically necessary
- Be overly formal or stiff
- Talk down to users

### Tone Examples

**Good:**
> "I was staying late every night writing notes. So I built this for my own practice. Works for me, might work for you."

**Bad:**
> "ClinicPro empowers healthcare professionals to revolutionize their clinical documentation workflow through cutting-edge AI technology."

**Good:**
> "Photo to desktop in 30 seconds. Always JPEG, auto-resized. Saves >10 minutes per referral."

**Bad:**
> "Our innovative platform leverages advanced compression algorithms to optimize your medical imaging workflow."

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary: NZ GPs (General Practitioners)
- Full-time GPs working in clinics
- Dealing with: admin overload, inbox overwhelm, workflow inefficiencies
- Tech comfort: Moderate (use PMS daily, but not developers)
- Pain points:
  - Staying late to write notes
  - Email-resize-upload workflow for referral photos
  - Cognitive load of remembering patient details during breaks
  - ACC form hunting
  - Dermatologists rejecting PDF photos

### Secondary: Practice Managers / Clinic Owners
- Looking for tools to reduce GP burnout
- Cost-conscious (hence "free" is important)
- Need simple, no-installation solutions

### What They Value
1. **Time savings** (specific: ">10 minutes per referral")
2. **Simplicity** (no installation, no training)
3. **Reliability** (GP-tested, actually works)
4. **NZ-specific** (data sovereignty, local compliance)
5. **Authenticity** (built by a GP who gets it)

---

## 3. Key Messaging

### Product Hierarchy
1. **Referral Images** (primary) - Live, working, free, main product
2. **AI Scribe** (secondary) - Beta, "if there's demand", acknowledge Heidi exists
3. **Inbox Intelligence** (future) - Building, R&D grant pending
4. **Clinical Orchestration** (vision) - Long-term, appropriately vague

### Core Value Propositions

#### Referral Images
- "Photo to desktop in 30 seconds"
- "Saves >10 minutes per referral"
- "Always JPEG (never PDF)" ← KEY DIFFERENTIATOR
- "Free for GPs"
- "Auto-sized for e-referrals"

#### AI Scribe
- "Reduces cognitive load"
- "Quality output, minimal edits"
- "I use it daily" ← CREDIBILITY
- "NZ data sovereignty"
- "Validates against NZ Formulary"

#### General ClinicPro

- "NZ-focused for general practice here"
- "No fluff - only what you need"
- "No VC funding, no corporate backing"

## 4. Terminology Standards

### Consistent Terms

| ClinicPro | Clinic Pro, clinicpro |
| Dr. Ryo / Ryo | Dr. Eguchi, Ryo Eguchi (use full name only on first mention) |
| NZ | New Zealand (except formal contexts) |
| GP | General Practitioner, doctor |
| e-referral | e-Referral, ereferral, eReferral |

### Specific Metrics
- Time saving: **">10 minutes per referral"** (not "30 minutes", not "saves time")
- File size: **"<500KB"** or **"under 500KB"**
- Transfer time: **"30 seconds"**
- Storage duration: **"24 hours"** or **"24h"**

- colour (not color)
- favour (not favor)
- centre (not center)
- defence (not defense)
- Labour (not Labor)

### Punctuation
- **NO en-dashes or em-dashes** - use hyphens or rewrite
- Use "e-referral" not "ereferral"
- Use apostrophes correctly: "it's" (it is), "GP's" (possessive)

## 5. Competitor Positioning

### Heidi (AI Scribe competitor)
**What it is:** Free AI scribe, Australian company, widely used

**Problems:**
- Hallucinations ("makes stuff up that's actually dangerous")
- Inconsistent quality
- Complex template customization
- Not NZ data sovereignty

**How we position:**
- Acknowledge: "Most GPs are happy with Heidi, and it's good"
- Differentiate: "If you want something more reliable with NZ data sovereignty, let me know"
- Never bash directly
- Focus on: quality, reliability, NZ hosting, simplicity

**Example:**
> "I use this daily - handles the cognitive load and outputs quality notes. Still in beta. Most GPs are happy with Heidi, but if you want something more reliable with NZ data sovereignty, let me know."

### MedImage (Referral Images competitor)
**What it is:** NZ app for GP photo transfer, requires PC software install, NZ$15 + $3/month

**Problems:**
- Creates PDFs (dermatologists reject these)
- Requires software installation
- Costs money
- Technical setup

**How we position:**
- Direct comparison in FAQ: "MedImage requires installing software on your PC and costs NZ$15 + $3/month. We're browser-only and free."
- Key differentiator: **"Always JPEG, never PDF"**
- Emphasize simplicity: "No installation, browser-only"

**Example:**
> "MedImage requires installing software on your PC and costs NZ$15 + $3/month. We're browser-only and free. More importantly: MedImage can create PDFs. We only create JPEGs - because dermatologists reject PDFs and ask for JPEGs instead."

## 6. Copy Guidelines by Section

### Headlines (H1s)
- Clear, benefit-focused
- Often questions or direct statements
- No hype words ("revolutionary", "game-changing")

**Good:**
- "Referral photos from phone to desktop in 30 seconds"
- "Stop trying to remember everything"
- "Hi, I'm Ryo."

**Bad:**
- "Transform Your Clinical Workflow Today"
- "The Future of Medical Documentation"
- "Innovative Solutions for Modern Healthcare"

### Subheadings (H2s, H3s)
- Conversational
- Often first-person or second-person
- Can be informal

**Good:**
- "Why I built this"
- "Quality output, minimal faffing"
- "Referrals sorted while you're consulting"

**Bad:**
- "Product Overview"
- "Key Features and Benefits"
- "Comprehensive Solution Suite"

### Body Copy
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Active voice
- Concrete examples
- Specific numbers when possible

**Good:**
> "You're seeing patients back-to-back. By your break, you're trying to remember what the 10am patient said about their chest pain. ClinicPro records everything - you focus on the patient, not note-taking during breaks."

**Bad:**
> "ClinicPro's advanced AI-powered documentation system enables healthcare professionals to maintain comprehensive patient records while optimizing their clinical workflow efficiency."

### CTAs (Calls to Action)
- Direct, not salesy
- Often softer than typical marketing
- Acknowledge user hesitation

**Good:**
- "Get Started - Free for GPs"
- "Get notified at launch"
- "Support This Project - $50"

**Bad:**
- "Start Your Free Trial Now!"
- "Unlock Premium Features Today!"
- "Join Thousands of Satisfied Users!"

### Social Proof
- Real quotes from real GPs (anonymous is fine)
- Vague numbers better than fake specific numbers
- Never inflate or exaggerate

**Good:**
- "Join NZ GPs already using this"
- "Used by GPs in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch"
- Real quote: "It's intolerable how long it takes" - NZ GP

**Bad:**
- "Join 50+ NZ GPs" (when you only have 12)
- "Trusted by thousands"
- Made-up testimonials

---

## 7. Pricing & Monetization Language

### Free Tier
- Always emphasize: "Free for GPs"
- "No credit card required"
- Explain why: "I built this for myself and colleagues"

### Paid Tier ($50 one-time)
- Frame as **support**, not payment
- "Support This Project - $50" (not "Upgrade", "Buy Premium")
- "$50 one-time (not a subscription)" - emphasize this
- "No VC funding, no corporate backing" - explain the why
- Generous: "If now's not the right time, I've given you 10 more free images"

**Good:**
> "I'm a fellow GP who built this to solve our shared workflow pain. No VC funding, no corporate backing. $50 one-time gets you unlimited images forever."

**Bad:**
> "Upgrade to Premium for just $50! Unlock unlimited access now!"

---

## 8. Email Copy Principles

### Subject Lines
- Clear, specific
- No clickbait
- No excessive emoji (max 1, often 0)

**Good:**
- "Your Referral Images links - ready to use"
- "You've saved 47 minutes this week"
- "You've hit your 10 free images this month"

**Bad:**
- "You Won't Believe How Much Time You'll Save! 🤯"
- "URGENT: Your Account Needs Attention"
- "Last Chance to Upgrade!"

### Email Greetings
- "Hi {name}," (if known)
- "Hi there," (if name unavailable)
- Never "Dear User", "Greetings", "Hello Doctor"

### Email Sign-offs
- Standard: "Cheers, Dr. Ryo"
- When asking for money: "Dr. Ryo, GP" (adds weight)
- Never: "Best regards", "Sincerely", "The ClinicPro Team"

### Email Tone
- Even more casual than website
- Direct, no fluff
- Assume they're busy (which they are)

## 9. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- "Real-time sync"
- "Advanced AI algorithms"

**Good:**
- "Handles complex consults with 3+ problems"
- "Photos appear on desktop in 30 seconds"
- "Outputs quality notes with minimal edits"

### ❌ Vague Benefits
**Bad:**
- "Save time"

- "No more email-resize-upload workflow"

### ❌ Corporate Speak
**Bad:**

- "Our platform leverages"
- "Cutting-edge solution"
- "Empowering healthcare professionals"

**Good:**
- "I built this because..."
- "This does X"
- "Simple tool for Y"

### ❌ Overselling
**Bad:**
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changer"

## 10. Real Examples (Good Copy)

### Homepage Hero
> Hi, I'm Ryo.
> 
> Auckland GP fixing the annoying bits of general practice.

**Why it works:** Personal, clear, relatable problem statement

### AI Scribe Mission
> Why I built this
> 
> I was spending breaks trying to remember what each patient said, then staying late writing notes. Free AI scribes hallucinate too much - I needed something reliable for my own practice. Works for me, might work for you.

**Why it works:** Personal story, honest about competition, humble close

### Referral Images Value Prop
> Always JPEG, Never PDF
> 
> Dermatologists reject PDFs. This creates JPEGs every time. No more "can you resend as JPEG" requests.

**Why it works:** Specific problem, concrete solution, real-world frustration

### Email - Limit Hit
> You've captured 10 images this month. The tool's clearly helping you.
> 
> I'm a fellow GP who built this to fix our shared workflow pain. No VC funding, no corporate backing.
> 
> $50 one-time gets you unlimited images forever.
> 
> No pressure. Thanks for trying it.
> 
> P.S. If now's not the right time, I've given you 10 more free images to keep using the tool.

**Why it works:** Personal, transparent about funding, generous fallback, no pressure

## 13. Quick Checklist for Copy Review

Before finalizing any copy, check:

- [ ] Is it conversational? (Read it aloud - does it sound natural?)
- [ ] Is it specific? (Numbers, examples, concrete details?)
- [ ] Is it honest? (No exaggeration, acknowledge limitations?)
- [ ] Is it personal? (First-person where appropriate?)
- [ ] NZ spelling? (practising, organise, etc.)
- [ ] Correct metrics? (>10 minutes, 30 seconds, <500KB)
- [ ] Consistent terms? (Inbox Intelligence not Inbox AI)
- [ ] No hype words? (revolutionary, game-changing, cutting-edge)
- [ ] No en-dashes? (use hyphens or rewrite)
- [ ] Authentic Ryo voice? (Would Ryo actually say this?)

---

## 14. When in Doubt

**Ask:**
1. "Would a GP in a tea room say this?"
2. "Is this specific enough to be useful?"
3. "Am I being honest about limitations?"
4. "Does this sound like Ryo or a marketing department?"

**Default to:**
- Simpler words
- Shorter sentences
- More personal tone
- Less hype
- More honesty
