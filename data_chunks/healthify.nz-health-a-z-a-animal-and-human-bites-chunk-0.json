Cat scratches can be as serious as cat bites, because cats constantly lick their claws and the claws carry germs from the cat’s mouth. People and animals have bacteria in their mouths which can easily lead to an infection if a bite breaks the skin. Even minor scrapes, such as in sports when someone’s mouth could graze your hand by accident, should be taken seriously. As long as animal and human bites are treated the wound is generally not serious but, if not treated, it can quickly become infected.\n####  What should I do if I have been bitten by a person or an animal? \n![Cat baring teeth bites into human arm](https://healthify.nz/assets/Legacy/15680/biting-cat-canva-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.png)\nImage credit: Canva\n  * Start by cleaning the bite. Run it under warm water for a few minutes. Wash the area even if the skin is intact.\n  ",
