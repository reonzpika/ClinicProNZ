  "content": "Autism shows up in many ways. We use the term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to describe the full range of symptoms and behaviours, from mild to extreme.\nPeople with ASD have a wide range of challenges and strengths that can vary with age and over time.\nSome people find out they have ASD as a tamaiti (child), while others may not find out until they're an adult.\n####  What causes autism? \nWe don't know exactly what causes autism. Research shows that genetic factors are important.\n####  What are the symptoms of autism in adults? \nCommon signs of autism in adults include:\n  * Engaging differently in social situations, such as: \n    * avoiding or feeling uncomfortable with eye contact\n    * finding it hard to make or keep friends, or preferring to be on your own\n    * being very honest and transparent, which may make other people misinterpret you as being rude or not interested in them\n    * finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling\n    * missing cues within conversation, such as body language, or whose turn it is\n    * finding it hard to say how you feel\n    * not understanding sarcasm or phrases such as 'break a leg' and taking things literally.\n  * Having repetitive behaviours or urges to move that seem unrelated to what's going on. These may increase if you're stressed, anxious or excited.\n  ",
