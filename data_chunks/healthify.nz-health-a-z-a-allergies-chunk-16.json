  "content": "* Aim for good ventilation throughout your house to avoid moist air build-up.\n  * Try to sleep with windows open to reduce the amount of moisture in the bedroom from breathing.\n\n\n####    \nPollen\n  * Keep the garden free of highly allergenic plants.\n  * Try to stay indoors at times when the pollen count is at its highest, eg, the early evening.\n  * Get someone else to mow your lawn.\n  * Close your bedroom windows at night to prevent pollen entering.\n  * Wear wrap-around sunglasses to avoid pollen getting into your eyes.\n  * Have a shower and wash your hair at night to wash away pollen you may have ‘collected’ during the day.\n  * Dry your clothes inside or in a tumble drier to avoid getting pollen on them.\n\n\n####    \nAnimal dander\n  * Keep pets outside, if possible.\n\n\n####    \nSkin allergies\n  * Avoid strong soaps, perfumes and household cleansing products that may irritate sensitive skin.\n  * Make sure jewellery and watches don't contain nickel, and are suitable for sensitive skin.\n\n\n####    \nInsect bites and stings\n  * Make sure you wear footwear outdoors.\n  * Cover your arms and legs.\n  * Don't make sudden moves when bees or wasps are around.\n  * Avoid strong perfume as it can attract insects.\n  * Wear gloves when gardening.\n  * Use insect repellent.\n\n\n####    \nFood allergies\nIf you have food allergies, know what they are and avoid those foods. A consultation with a dietitian can help you work out how to do this and still have a healthy, balanced diet. Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a dietitian. Read more about [food allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies).\n####  How can I care for myself with allergies? \n#### Avoid allergies\nIt's not always practical to avoid the allergens you are allergic to. However, some things you can do include:\n  * being careful about what you eat if you have food allergies\n  * avoiding exposure to pets if you have animal allergies\n  * keeping your home warm and dry if you have mould allergies\n  * staying indoors and avoiding grassy areas if you have hay fever.\n\n\n####    \nCarry adrenaline\nIf you're at risk of life-threatening allergic reactions, carry adrenaline with you at all times. You also need to be trained in the correct use of an adrenaline auto-injector, EpiPen. Partners of adults should also be familiar with these devices.  \n  \nFor children with allergies, parents or caregivers (including at daycare and schools) should also be familiar with how to use the EpiPen. \n####    \nAllergic reaction action plan\nAllergic reactions can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from mild to moderate reactions, through to severe and life-threatening reactions ([anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\")). You and your whānau need to be able to recognise the signs of an allergic reaction and anaphylaxis, and know what to do in an emergency.   \n  \nAn allergic reaction action plan is a written document that outlines what to do if you have an allergic reaction. \n  * Here are [plans from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA).(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/hp/ascia-plans-action-and-treatment \"Open external link\")\n\n\nCarry your allergy action plan at all times or put your action plan somewhere you can easily find it in your home. If you don’t have an action plan, ask your healthcare provider to fill out one with you.\n####    \nWear a medical bracelet\nWear a medical bracelet stating what you are allergic to. This can be very helpful for health professionals when treating you.\n####    \nRemind your healthcare team\nAlways remind your healthcare provider or pharmacist about your allergies before starting any new treatment, including complementary, over-the-counter and herbal medicines.\n####  What support is available with allergies? \n[Allergy New Zealand(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") provides information, education and support for people with allergy, parents of children with allergy, teachers and health professionals. \n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\")  \n[EpiPen®](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/e/epipen \"EpiPen®\")  \n[Allergy tips for school children](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies-tips-for-children-starting-school \"Allergy tips for school children\")  \n[Hay fever | Mate hei](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever | Mate hei\")  \n[Hives | Mate kārawa](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hives \"Hives | Mate kārawa\")  \n[Food allergy topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-topics \"Food allergy topics\")\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about allergies.
