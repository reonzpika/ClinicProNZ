  "content": "Some people breathe using their chest muscles instead of their diaphragm. This takes extra effort and can cause fatigue and tension.\nTest yourself to see whether you breathe correctly through your diaphragm (diaphragmatic breathing):\n  * Sit upright and relax your shoulders.\n  * Rest one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.\n  * Breathe in deeply through your nose and pay attention to the movement of your hands.\n  * If you are using your diaphragm to breathe, the hand on your stomach will move.\n  * If you are using your chest muscles to breathe, the hand on your chest will move.\n  * Practice both ways of breathing and feel the difference.\n\n\nIf you are a chest-breather, practice diaphragmatic breathing for a few moments several times a day. Soon, diaphragmatic breathing will be automatic.\n####    \nRelax while breathing out\nIt's important to relax and let the air flow out of your lungs slowly and freely. Take a moment to remind yourself how good it feels.\n  * Sit upright and relax your shoulders.\n  * Remember to breathe through your nose.\n  * Using your diaphragm, breathe in gently and fully, then just let go.\n  * Feel the air flow out fully and effortlessly.\n\n\nPractice relaxing while you breathe out, and it will become automatic.\n####    \nBreathe rhythmically\nMost people breathe faster when they are tense or anxious. Their breathing becomes short and shallow. This type of breathing is both inefficient and tiring, and it can make you feel uptight or frightened.\nSlow rhythmic breathing can help calm you. Practice this exercise several times a day.\n  * Sit upright and relax your shoulders.\n  * Breathe in gently and fully using your diaphragm.\n  * Let your breath flow out freely.\n  ",
