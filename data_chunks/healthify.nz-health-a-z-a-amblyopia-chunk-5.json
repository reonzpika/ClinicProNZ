  "content": "The eye that's not straight doesn't see as it should. It becomes weaker. It's not receiving as clear a picture as the other eye. The part of the brain responsible for vision in that eye also doesn't develop properly. This is called amblyopia.  \n  \nIf left untreated it can lead to very poor vision. After the age of 5 and a half years, it gets more difficult to reverse amblyopia. After 7 years, it is usually impossible.  \n  \nAmblyopia is the most common cause of poor vision in children.\n####  What are the causes of amblyopia? \nThe most common causes of amblyopia are:\n  * a squint\n  * refractive error (abnormal focus)\n  * ptosis (droopy eyelid)\n  * cloudiness in one eye.\n\n\n####  What is the treatment for amblyopia? (+ APPS) \nTo reverse amblyopia and bring the vision back in the weaker eye, your child's treatment will focus on making their brain use the weaker eye again.  \n  \nTreatment for amblyopia is patching and/or glasses. When treatment starts at an early age, vision often improves. \n#### Eye patching\nPatching or covering the good eye is the most common way of encouraging your child to use the weaker eye.\n![Small child wearing glasses with one lens patched](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Eye-topics/Small-child-with-glasses-and-eye-patch-canva-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\nImage credit: Canva\n  \nIf your child's treatment includes patching, their eye specialist may recommend patching either:\n  * Full-time – your child wears the patch all day every day.\n  * Part-time – for a certain number of hours a day. \n\n\nAfter a set period, your child will have a vision check.\n",
