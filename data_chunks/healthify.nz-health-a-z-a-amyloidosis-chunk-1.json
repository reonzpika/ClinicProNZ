  "content": "Amyloidosis is diagnosed by biopsy, where a tissue sample is taken from the affected organ so it can be examined closely. Specialised testing of the tissue can help work out the type of abnormal protein involved.\n####  How is amyloidosis treated? (+ APPS) \nThere is no cure for amyloidosis. However, treatment can help manage symptoms and limit more amyloid protein being produced, therefore limiting further damage to the affected organ. If the amyloidosis has been triggered by another condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or TB, treating the underlying condition can help.\nMany of the same types of medicines used to treat some forms of cancer are used in AL amyloidosis. These stop the growth of abnormal cells that produce the protein leading to the amyloid forming.\n#### Support\n[NZ Amyloidosis Patients Association(external link)(external link)](https://amyloidosis.co.nz/ \"Open external link\") Awareness, advocacy and support for people with amyloidosis and their carers.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps) and [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Rheumatoid arthritis | Mate rumatiki](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid arthritis | Mate rumatiki\")  \n[TB](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/t/tuberculosis)  \n[Rare disorders](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rare-disorders \"Rare disorders\")\n####  More information \n[Amyloidosis(external link)(external link)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353178 \"Open external link\") Mayo Clinic, US\n#### References\n  1.
