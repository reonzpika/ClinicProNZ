Sometimes your heart changes between beating slowly for a while and then fast for a while.\n####  How can I care for myself with an arrhythmia? (+ APPS) \nIf you have lots of ectopic beats or often have episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), avoiding alcohol, caffeine and drugs (eg, methamphetamine) can help.\nAnxiety can make ectopic beats more noticeable, so breathing and relaxation techniques can help. You may find it useful to look at some [Breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps), [Anxiety management apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/anxiety-apps) and [Meditation and mindfulness apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/m/meditation-and-mindfulness-apps).\nIf you're prescribed medicine it's important to continue taking it because the complications of untreated arrhythmias can be serious. If you have questions or side effects talk with your healthcare provider about making changes.\nIf you have collapsed or nearly collapsed because of an arrhythmia you won't be able to drive until it's been treated and you've had no symptoms for 3 months. Your healthcare provider will let you know about any driving or work restrictions due to other symptoms or procedures.\n####  How are arrhythmias treated? \nSome arrhythmias (eg, ectopic beats) don't need treatment.\nOthers can be treated with medicine, either just when they are happening or daily for prevention.\nSometimes cardioversion is used. This involves being given an anaesthetic to put you to sleep and your heart is given an electric shock. This stops the abnormal rhythm and your normal rhythm starts again. \nArtificial [pacemakers](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pacemaker) are used for complete heart block and sick sinus syndrome.\nIf you have episodes of life-threatening arrhythmias you can have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) inserted under the skin of your chest, which gives an electrical shock when it detects an abnormal rhythm.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Pulse and heart rate – how to check](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pulse-and-heart-rate-how-to-check)  \n[Palpitations](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/palpitations)  \n[Atrial fibrillation](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/atrial-fibrillation)  \n[Pacemaker](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pacemaker)\n####  More information \n[How the heart works(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/how-the-heart-works \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ  \n[Abnormal heart rhythms(external link)](https://patient.info/heart-health/palpitations-leaflet/abnormal-heart-rhythms-arrhythmias \"Open external link\") Patient Info, UK\n#### Brochure\nThe following link provides further information about arrhythmias.
