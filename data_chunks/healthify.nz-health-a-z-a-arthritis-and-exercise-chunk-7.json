  "content": "Ideally the ‘want’ column will be more emotionally connected. Keep this list handy and refer to it regularly to remind yourself of your WHY. \n\n\n**Examples may be:**  \nI want to exercise to be able to play with my children or mokopuna.  \nI want to exercise so that I don’t end up in a wheelchair when I am older.  \nI want to exercise because it makes me feel good about myself afterwards.\n  * **Be flexible****PLAN B**\n\n\n  * **Set realistic goals**[setting goals](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/g/making-changes-goal-setting).\n\n\n  * **Reward yourself** when you hit a goal or target.\n\n\n  * **Run a movie** _“I’ll feel great when I have done this”_ _“I always feel better when I exercise”._\n\n\n  * **Start short.**\n  * **Move to music.**\n\n\n  * **Lay out your exercise clothes**\n\n\n  * **Make a date.** Just as you would for any appointment or meeting, diarise your exercise and only miss doing it under extreme circumstances.\n\n\n  * **‘Phone a friend’** Speaking to or exchanging texts with someone who supports you is often the little nudge you need when it is tough to get going.\n\n\n  * **Embrace social media.** Join a Facebook page with others that understand your situation.
