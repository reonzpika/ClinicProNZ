  "content": "Unstable angina is a sign of more severe heart disease and may lead to a heart attack. What happens in the future will depend on things such as:\n  * how many of your arteries are affected by coronary artery disease\n  * how severe the narrowing is\n  * if you’ve had a heart attack before, and \n  * how well your heart is working to pump blood around your body.\n\n\nHaving coronary artery disease means you’re likely to have atherosclerosis in other arteries (eg, the arteries that supply your brain), so you’re at higher risk of having a stroke.\n####  What support is available if I have angina? \nSometimes it can be helpful to talk with someone who knows what it’s like to live with heart disease and angina.
