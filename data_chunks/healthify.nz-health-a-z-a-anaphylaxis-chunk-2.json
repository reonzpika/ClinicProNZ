  "content": "It's an over-reaction by your immune system to the allergen trigger. It can make your airways tighten, which restricts your breathing, or affect the circulation of blood in your body, and it can be life threatening.\nAn allergen can be anything, but common triggers of anaphylaxis include:\n  * food\n  * insect venom\n  * medicines.\n\n\nIn some cases, the cause may take some time to be identified.\n#### Food\n  * Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, fish, shellfish, wheat and soy are the most common food triggers, and cause 90% of allergic reactions. However, any food can trigger anaphylaxis.\n  * In some cases, mild or moderate allergic symptoms can happen before the above symptoms, such as\n  * swelling of your face, lips or eyes\n  * hives, welts or body redness\n  * tingling of your mouth\n  * tummy pain or vomiting (being sick).\n  * Having asthma can also increase the risk of having a severe reaction if you accidentally eat even a small amount of the food you are allergic to.\n\n\n####    \nInsect venom\nBee and wasp stings are the most common causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n####    \nMedicines\nBoth over-the-counter and prescribed medicines, such as antibiotics or painkillers, can cause life-threatening allergic reactions. You can also have anaphylactic reactions to herbal or alternative medicines. ",
