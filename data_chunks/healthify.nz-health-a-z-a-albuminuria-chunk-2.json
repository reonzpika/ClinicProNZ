The following table is a guide from the LabPLUS medical diagnostic library.\n| **Men** | **Women**  \n---|---|---  \nNormal |  <2.5 |  <3.5  \nEarly albuminuria | 2.5–25 | 3.5–35  \nAlbuminuria | >25 | >35  \n####  How is albuminuria treated? (+ APPS) \nYour healthcare provider will monitor the level of albumin in your urine to find out if it's increasing or decreasing. Further tests may be needed to investigate the cause and extent of any kidney damage.\nIf your albuminuria is associated with a long-term health condition (eg, diabetes or high blood pressure), the first goal will be better self-management of the conditions.\nYour healthcare provider may prescribe [ACE inhibitors](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/ace-inhibitors) or [angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/angiotensin-receptor-blockers-arbs). These medicines have been found to protect kidney function while controlling blood pressure.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Kidney disease apps,](https://healthify.nz/apps/k/kidney-disease-apps) [Diabetes apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/d/diabetes-apps), [Blood pressure apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/blood-pressure-apps) or [Heart failure apps](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/albuminuria).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Urine testing](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/u/urine-testing)  \n[Kidney disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/k/kidney-disease)  \n[Diabetes](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/diabetes-overview)  \n[High blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high)\n####  More information \n#### Brochures\nThe following links have more information on albuminuria.
