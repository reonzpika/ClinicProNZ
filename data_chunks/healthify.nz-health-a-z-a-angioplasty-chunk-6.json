It keeps the blood vessel open and allows blood to flow more freely.\n\n\n![Two men socialising in South Auckland](https://healthify.nz/assets/Maori-and-Pasifika-people-/Two-men-socialising-HN.png)\nQR Code Print\n####  What is angioplasty and when is it performed? \n#### What is it?\nAngioplasty is a procedure to widen a blocked or narrowed coronary artery to improve blood flow to your heart.\n",
