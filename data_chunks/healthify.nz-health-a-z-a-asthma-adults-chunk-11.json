  "content": "Asthma treatment aims to keep your symptoms under control and prevent asthma attacks, or sudden worsening of symptoms. This is so that your asthma doesn't interfere with your daily activities and you can enjoy a full and active life.\n####    \nTreatment\nTreatment of asthma consists of inhaled medicines. It's crucial to receive good education on how to use the different inhalers properly.\nThere are 2 types of inhalers:\n  * Metered dose inhalers (MDIs), and\n  * dry powder inhalers.\n\n\nMDIs are best used with a spacer to make sure the medicine is delivered to your small airways or breathing tubes. \nGenerally there are 2 main approaches to the treatment of asthma, depending on whether you are using a budesonide/formoterol inhaler or a steroid inhaler with/without long-acting bronchodilator. \n####    \nBudesonide/formoterol\nExamples of Budesonide/formoterol inhalers:\n  * [Symbicort Turbuhaler](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/symbicort-for-asthma \"Symbicort\")\n  * [Vannair Inhaler](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/v/vannair-for-asthma)\n  * [DuoResp Spiromax](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/duoresp-spiromax \"DuoResp Spiromax\")\n\n\n**Mild symptoms**\n  * Use budesonide/formoterol when required for relief of asthma.\n  * This is also called **a** nti-**i** nflammatory **r** eliever (AIR) therapy or **s** ingle-inhaler **m** aintenance **a** nd **r** eliever (SMART) **t** herapy.\n\n\nModerate to severe symptoms\n  * Use budesonide/formoterol every day **PLUS** when required for relief of asthma symptoms.\n  * Also called **s** ingle-inhaler **m** aintenance **a** nd **r** eliever (SMART) **t** herapy.\n\n\n####    \nSteroid inhaler with/without long-acting bronchodilator\n**Mild symptoms**\n  * Use your steroid inhaler every day, even when you're not having symptoms.\n  * Examples of steroid inhalers include: \n    * [Beclometasone ](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/beclometasone-inhaler)(Beclazone®, Qvar®)\n    * [Budesonide ](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/budesonide-inhaler)(Pulmicort®)\n    * [Fluticasone ](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/f/fluticasone-inhaler-and-accuhaler)(Flixotide®)\n\n\n  * Use [salbutamol](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/salbutamol) or [terbutaline](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/terbutaline) for symptom relief when needed.\n  * If you’re using them more than twice a week, see your healthcare provider to review your treatment.\n\n\n**Moderate to severe symptoms**\n  * Use your **steroid inhaler** PLUS **long-acting bronchodilator** every day, even when you're not having symptoms.\n  * For examples of steroid inhalers and long-acting bronchodilator inhalers, see [asthma medications](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/asthma-medication \"Medication\").\n  * Use[salbutamol](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/salbutamol \"Salbutamol\") or[terbutaline](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/terbutaline \"Terbutaline\")\n  * If you're are using them more than twice a week, see your healthcare provider to review your treatment.\n\n\nFor severe flare ups or exacerbations of asthma or for asthma attacks your healthcare provider will prescribe prednisone for a short period. Prednisone is a tablet to help reduce inflammation. It shouldn't generally be used long term for asthma treatment. If you need prednisone regularly each year you should be referred to a specialist clinic. Extra inhaler treatment might be needed or, for some people, new generation biological treatments (eg, [benralizumab](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/benralizumab), [mepolizumab](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/mepolizumab)).\nAfter each flare up you should have your inhalers reviewed – including your preventer treatment and your asthma action plan.\nThere are other less commonly used medicines for asthma prevention such as [montelukast](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/montelukast) tablets.\n####    \nFlu and COVID-19 vaccines\nPeople with asthma are at increased risk of complications from the flu, even if their symptoms are mild or well-controlled by medicine. Complications include[pneumonia (lung infection)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pneumonia \"Pneumonia\"),[heart failure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-failure \"Heart failure\")\n  * Ask your healthcare provider about getting the flu vaccination to reduce your risk of flu.\n  * The flu vaccine is usually free for people with asthma, if you are on regular preventative therapy.\n  * It is best to get vaccinated before the start of the winter season, before the flu enters the community.\n  ",
