This treatment is also called allergen immunotherapy (AIT) or allergen vaccination and is done by a clinical immunologist.  \n  \nIt involves a series of injections of the allergen just below the skin surface. The injections start off with a very small amount of the allergen and the dose is gradually increased so that your body builds up immunity to the allergen. After the maximum dose is given, regular injections are given for 3 to 5 years to keep up the immunity. \n#### What support is available with dust mite allergy?\n[Allergy New Zealand(external link)(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") provides information, education and support for people with allergy, parents of children with allergy, teachers and healthcare professionals. \n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps) and [Eczema apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/eczema-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies \"Allergies\")  \n[Allergies due to food](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies)  \n[Allergy tips for school children](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies-tips-for-children-starting-school \"Allergy tips for school children\")  \n[Antihistamines](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/antihistamines \"Antihistamines\")  \n[Hay fever | Mate hei](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever | Mate hei\")\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about dust mites allergy.
