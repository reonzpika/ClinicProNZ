It's not clear why some children have asthma when others don't.\nAsthma in children is more likely if:\n  * a mother smoked during pregnancy \n  * a child has [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema-children), [hay fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever) or allergies\n  * there is asthma in the family – parent, brother or sister\n  * one or both parents have an allergic condition, eg, asthma, hay fever or eczema.\n\n\nModern Western lifestyle may play a part in the rise in asthma that has happened over the last few decades. Changes in housing, diet and a more hygienic environment may contribute. ",
