  "content": "* Don’t use vaginal douches. You don’t need to clean inside your vagina as it’s self-cleaning.\n  * Use emollient cream or petroleum jelly if your vulva is dry or itchy.\n  * Try a vaginal moisturiser.\n  * Use a water-based vaginal lubricant when you have sex.\n  * Some medicines may cause vaginal dryness, eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, decongestants, antidepressants. If you take medicines, talk to your healthcare provider about whether vaginal dryness could be a side effect. If so there may be an alternative you could take instead.\n  * Avoid perfumed soaps, shampoos, antiseptics, bubble baths or other products that could irritate your skin.\n  * Wear cotton underwear and change your underwear each day. Natural fibres such as cotton are more breathable which allows airflow around the skin and keeps it healthy.\n  * Prioritise your sexual health. Discuss the impacts of your symptoms with your partner. Enjoy more sexual foreplay to increase vaginal lubrication during sex.\n\n\n####  How can I prevent genitourinary syndrome of menopause? \nLower oestrogen levels are a natural part of going through the menopause, but there are things you can do to stop atrophic vaginitis from getting worse.\n  * Don’t use products that irritate your vagina, such as perfumes, dyes, shampoo, detergents or douches to clean the inside of your vagina.\n  * Regular sexual activity, with or without a partner, is good for atrophic vaginitis as it increases blood flow to your vaginal tissue and helps keep it healthy.\n  * Avoid smoking – smoking can lessen blood flow to your vagina and also reduces the effects of oestrogen in your body. It can also worsen dry skin problems.\n\n\n####  What will happen in the future if I have genitourinary syndrome of menopause? \nGenitourinary syndrome of menopause can’t be cured, but you don’t have to live with the discomfort of vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms such as incontinence and needing to pee often.\nThere are hormonal and non-hormonal treatments that can successfully manage your symptoms, but it’s important to treat atrophic vaginitis as soon as possible to stop it getting worse. It’s a good idea to discuss this with a healthcare provider and be examined by them to check there are no other issues that need to be addressed.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Vaginal dryness – what to do](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/v/vaginal-dryness)  \n[Vulvovaginitis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/v/vulvovaginitis-in-adult-women)  \n[Menopause](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/menopause)  \n[Menopause – let's talk about it](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/menopause-lets-talk-about-it)  \n[Bleeding after sex](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/bleeding-after-sex)  \n[Bladder control problems](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/bladder-control-problems)  \n[Sex and ageing](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sex-and-ageing)\n####  More information \n#### Brochures\n[Vulvovaginal symptoms after menopause – information sheet(external link)](https://www.menopause.org.au/images/stories/infosheets/docs/AMS_Vulvovaginal_symptoms_after_menopause.pdf \"Open external link\") Australian Menopause Society, Australia  \n[Atrophic vaginitis(external link)](https://wisdom.nhs.wales/health-board-guidelines/c-vgleafletfile/atrophic-vaginitis2cvg-leaflet-2022pdf/ \"Open external link\") NHS, UK\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
