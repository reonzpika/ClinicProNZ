# Autonomous Project Updates

## Principle

**AI updates project documentation AFTER work is complete (plans finalized, implementations done, tasks finished). User never needs to manually edit project files.**

**Philosophy**: Documentation is a byproduct of work completion, not a separate activity.

**Two Areas of Work**:

### Area 1: Project Documentation (`/project-management/` folder)
- Files: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`, major project files
- Behavior: **Autonomous updates** (no approval needed)
- Timing: After plans are finalized OR after implementation is complete
- User never manually edits these files

### Area 2: Codebase (rest of repository)
- Files: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, components, configs, etc.
- Behavior: **Discuss → Suggest → Approve → Implement**
- Timing: Only after user explicitly approves implementation
- After implementation → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md automatically

---

## When to Update Project Documentation

### Timing Rules:

**✅ DO UPDATE:**
1. **After Implementation Complete**
   - Code changes finished → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - Task accomplished → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - Feature shipped → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

2. **After Plan is Finalized** (even if implementation deferred)
   - Discussion concludes with clear plan → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with plan
   - Decisions made (even if implementation is "next week") → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - Approach agreed upon → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
   - User says "let's do this next week" → Still update with plan

**❌ DON'T UPDATE:**
- ❌ While exploring options → Stay in chat, don't update files
- ❌ While iterating on approach → Stay in chat, don't update files
- ❌ While gathering requirements → Stay in chat, don't update files
- ❌ During active discussion → Keep in chat only

## Update Triggers (After Completion or Plan Finalization)

### 1. Task Completion

**User says**: "I finished implementing auth", "Built the landing page", "Completed the design", "Shipped to production", "Done with X"

**AI action** (AFTER user confirms completion): 
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Progress [DATE]`
- Check if it's a milestone → update milestone status
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md highlights
- Celebrate the achievement in response

**Format**:
```markdown
## Progress [2025-11-10]
- ✅ Auth system implementation complete
- ✅ Landing page built and deployed
```

---

### 2. Blocker Identified

**User says**: "Can't get the API working", "Stuck on deployment", "Waiting for approval", "Hit rate limits"

**AI action** (AFTER discussing the blocker and understanding it):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Blockers [DATE]`
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Top Blockers & Risks section
- Document after blocker is clearly identified

**Format**:
```markdown
## Blockers [2025-11-10]
- ⚠️ API rate limiting preventing bulk operations - investigating caching solution
- ⚠️ Waiting for Medtech approval (emailed 2025-11-07, awaiting response)
```

---

### 3. Decision Made

**User says**: "I'm going with PostgreSQL", "Decided to target SMBs first", "Pricing will be $29/month", "Let's drop feature X"

**AI action** (AFTER discussion concludes with clear decision):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Decisions [DATE]`
- Document rationale from conversation context
- Update relevant sections (tech stack, target audience, pricing, scope)
- **Even if implementation is deferred** ("let's do this next week"), log the decision

**Format**:
```markdown
## Decisions [2025-11-10]

### Technology Stack: PostgreSQL over MySQL
**Rationale**: Better JSON support, more familiar to team, stronger ecosystem for our use case
**Impact**: Database design, hosting requirements
**Implementation**: Deferred to next sprint
```

---

### 4. Date/Deadline/Meeting Mentioned

**User says**: "Meeting on Tuesday", "Launch by end of month", "Demo next Friday at 2pm"

**AI action** (immediately):
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Schedule section (Upcoming Events table)
- Extract: date, time, event, project context, event type

**Format** (in PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md):
```markdown
| Date | Time | Event | Project | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| 2025-11-12 | 2:00pm | Demo session | Medtech Integration | Meeting | First user demo |
```

---

### 5. Milestone Reached

**User says**: "Got first paying customer!", "Reached 100 users", "MVP is live", "Grant approved!"

**AI action** (AFTER user confirms milestone achieved):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Milestones [DATE]`
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md achievements
- Update project stage if appropriate
- Celebrate the win enthusiastically

**Format**:
```markdown
## Milestones [2025-11-10]
- 🎉 First paying customer: $29/month subscription
- 🎉 MVP deployed to production
```

---

### 6. Risk/Concern Raised

**User says**: "Worried about competition", "Not sure if market is big enough", "Might run out of runway"

**AI action** (AFTER discussing the risk and understanding it):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Risks [DATE]`
- Flag in PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Top Blockers & Risks

**Format**:
```markdown
## Risks [2025-11-10]
- 🔴 High: Competition from Heidi Health (freemium model, established brand)
  - Mitigation: Focus on unique integration features, target underserved segment
```

---

### 7. Learning/Insight Discovered

**User says**: "Users don't actually want feature X", "Discovered the real problem is Y", "Failed experiment taught me..."

**AI action** (AFTER learning is clear from discussion):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Learnings [DATE]`
- Update strategy/roadmap if relevant

**Format**:
```markdown
## Learnings [2025-11-10]
- Users care more about integration speed than UI polish
  - Source: 5 customer interviews
  - Action: Prioritizing API performance over design iteration
```

---

### 8. Plan Finalized (Even If Implementation Deferred)

**User says**: "I'll talk to 5 more users next week", "We agreed to build API with these endpoints", "Let's do drag-and-drop next sprint"

**AI action** (AFTER plan is clear, even if implementation is later):
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Plans [DATE]` or `## Next Actions [DATE]`
- Document the agreed approach
- Include "implementation scheduled for [timeframe]" if deferred

**Format**:
```markdown
## Plans [2025-11-10]
- Add drag-and-drop to medtech widget with visual feedback
  - Approach: Use react-dropzone library, implement drop overlay, add file validation
  - Implementation: Scheduled for next week
  - Status: Plan finalized, awaiting implementation
```

---

### 9. Stage Transition Indicators

**AI detects patterns that suggest stage change**:
- Ideation → Validation: User starts talking to customers, validating assumptions
- Validation → Build: "Starting to build", "MVP in progress", "coding started"
- Build → Operational: "Launched", "in production", "have paying customers"

**AI action** (when clear):
- Update `project_stage` in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md YAML
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md stage column
- Mention stage transition explicitly

---

## Code Implementation Workflow

**For codebase changes, follow this sequence:**

### 1. Discussion Phase (Stay in Chat)
```
User: "I want to work on medtech UI improvement"
AI: [Reads project context] "What specific UI problems are you experiencing?"
User: "Upload is confusing, no drag-drop"
AI: "I can add drag-and-drop with visual feedback. Would you like me to implement?"
```
**During this phase: NO file updates yet**

### 2. Implementation Approved
```
User: "Yes, let's do it"
AI: [Implements code changes]
```

### 3. Implementation Complete → Update Docs
```
AI: [After code changes complete]
    - Updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with what was implemented
    - Updates PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md if significant
```

**End of session summary:**
```
📝 Project Updates (Medtech Integration):
✓ Implemented: Drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback
✓ Updated: PROJECT_SUMMARY.md with implementation details
✓ Files changed: 3 components (page.tsx, CapturePanel.tsx, MetadataForm.tsx)

Your project summary is current.
```

---

## Explicit Override Phrases

**User can force immediate PROJECT_SUMMARY.md updates with these phrases:**

- "update project summary" → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md immediately
- "log this as a decision" → Add to Decisions section immediately
- "log this as a blocker" → Add to Blockers section immediately
- "document this learning" → Add to Learnings section immediately
- "add this to the project" → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md immediately

**Example:**
```
User: "Actually, log this decision: we're postponing mobile app for Q2"
AI: [Immediately updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under Decisions section]
    "Logged decision to defer mobile app to Q2."
```

---

## Update Confirmation Pattern

### During Discussion:
- Stay in chat
- Don't update files yet
- Focus on helping user

### After Completion:
- Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md
- Brief mention: "I've updated the project summary with this completion."

### End of Session:
- Comprehensive summary of all updates

**Example:**
```
📝 Project Updates (Medtech Integration):
✓ Completed: Drag-and-drop implementation
✓ Logged decision: Using react-dropzone library
✓ Documented plan: Mobile responsiveness next sprint

Your project summary is current. Next session, I'll have this context.
```

---

## File Update Mechanics

### PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Updates:

**Append, don't overwrite**:
```markdown
## Progress [2025-11-10]
- Existing progress item
- New item from today's work ← Added after completion

## Plans [2025-11-10]
- Agreed plan from discussion ← Added after plan finalized
```

**Update metadata**:
- `last_updated: "2025-11-10"`
- Bump `version` (patch increment)

---

### PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Updates:

**Always sync when PROJECT_SUMMARY.md changes**:
1. Update index table (last_updated, stage if changed)
2. Update Highlights section (recent achievements, blockers)
3. Update Schedule section (dates mentioned)
4. Update Project Details section (summary, status)
5. Update YAML metadata

---

## Safeguards

### AI Freely Does (Safe Operations in `/project-management/`):
- ✅ Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md after task completion
- ✅ Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md after plan is finalized
- ✅ Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md to sync with PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Add information from completed work
- ✅ Log decisions after discussion concludes
- ✅ Track blockers after they're identified
- ✅ Document plans even if implementation is deferred

### AI Always Asks (Destructive Operations):
- ⚠️ Archive project
- ⚠️ Delete milestones
- ⚠️ Remove decisions
- ⚠️ Change project ownership

### AI Never Does (Wrong Context):
- ❌ Update based on casual mentions ("I might try X someday")
- ❌ Update based on questions ("Should I do Y?")
- ❌ Update during active discussion (wait for completion or plan finalization)
- ❌ Update when context is unclear

---

## Error Recovery

### If AI Updates Too Early:
```
User: "Wait, we're still discussing, don't update yet"
AI: "Got it. I'll hold off on updates until we finalize the plan."
```

### If AI Misses an Update:
```
User: "Can you update the project summary with what we just agreed?"
AI: [Updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md immediately with the plan/decision]
```

### If Wrong Information Logged:
```
User: "No, that's not what I meant"
AI: "Sorry, let me correct that."
[Updates with correct information]
```

---

## Success Metrics

**System is working well when**:
- ✅ User never manually edits PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Updates happen after completion, not during discussion
- ✅ Plans are documented even when implementation is deferred
- ✅ Session summaries accurately reflect what was accomplished
- ✅ Documentation stays current effortlessly

**System needs tuning when**:
- ❌ AI updates files during discussion (too early)
- ❌ AI forgets to update after implementation (too late)
- ❌ User says "you didn't document X" (missed update)
- ❌ Session summaries are wrong
