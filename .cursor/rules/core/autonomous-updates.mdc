# Autonomous Project Updates

## Principle

**AI continuously extracts trackable information from conversation and updates project files in the background. User never needs to manually edit project files.**

**Philosophy**: Documentation is a byproduct of conversation, not a separate activity.

---

## Conversational Triggers (Auto-Update)

### 1. Task Completion Mentioned

**User says**: "I finished implementing auth", "Built the landing page", "Completed the design", "Shipped to production"

**AI action**: 
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Progress [DATE]`
- Check if it's a milestone → update milestone status
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md highlights
- Celebrate the achievement in response

**Format**:
```markdown
## Progress [2025-11-09]
- ✅ Auth system implementation complete
- ✅ Landing page built and deployed
```

---

### 2. Blocker Mentioned

**User says**: "Can't get the API working", "Stuck on deployment", "Waiting for approval", "Hit rate limits", "Dependencies not working"

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Blockers [DATE]`
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Top Blockers & Risks section
- Suggest solutions or next steps in response
- Track for follow-up

**Format**:
```markdown
## Blockers [2025-11-09]
- ⚠️ API rate limiting preventing bulk operations - investigating caching solution
- ⚠️ Waiting for Medtech approval (emailed 2025-11-07, awaiting response)
```

---

### 3. Decision Made

**User says**: "I'm going with PostgreSQL", "Decided to target SMBs first", "Pricing will be $29/month", "Dropping feature X from MVP"

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Decisions [DATE]`
- Document rationale from conversation context
- Update relevant sections (tech stack, target audience, pricing, scope)
- Reference decision in future guidance

**Format**:
```markdown
## Decisions [2025-11-09]

### Technology Stack: PostgreSQL over MySQL
**Rationale**: Better JSON support, more familiar to team, stronger ecosystem for our use case
**Impact**: Database design, hosting requirements
```

---

### 4. Date/Deadline/Meeting Mentioned

**User says**: "Meeting on Tuesday", "Launch by end of month", "Demo next Friday at 2pm", "Grant due mid-December", "Meeting with mentor Nov 12"

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Schedule section (Upcoming Events table)
- Extract: date, time, event, project context, event type
- Set as upcoming event
- Reminder in future conversations if approaching

**Format** (in PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md):
```markdown
| Date | Time | Event | Project | Type | Notes |
|------|------|-------|---------|------|-------|
| 2025-11-12 | 2:00pm | Demo session | MVP | Meeting | First user demo |
```

---

### 5. Milestone Reached

**User says**: "Got first paying customer!", "Reached 100 users", "MVP is live", "Validated with 10 customers", "Grant approved!"

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Milestones [DATE]`
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md achievements
- Update project stage if appropriate (e.g., Validation → Build when MVP starts)
- Celebrate the win enthusiastically in response

**Format**:
```markdown
## Milestones [2025-11-09]
- 🎉 First paying customer: $29/month subscription
- 🎉 MVP deployed to production
- 🎉 Validation complete: 10 customer interviews, 8 positive responses
```

---

### 6. Risk/Concern Raised

**User says**: "Worried about competition", "Not sure if market is big enough", "Might run out of runway", "Team capacity is limited", "Competitor launched similar feature"

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Risks [DATE]`
- Flag in PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Top Blockers & Risks
- Offer strategic guidance in response
- Track severity (High/Medium/Low based on user's tone/context)

**Format**:
```markdown
## Risks [2025-11-09]
- 🔴 High: Competition from Heidi Health (freemium model, established brand)
  - Mitigation: Focus on unique integration features, target underserved segment
- 🟡 Medium: Limited runway (3 months remaining)
  - Mitigation: Focus on revenue-generating features, consider grant funding
```

---

### 7. Learning/Insight Shared

**User says**: "Users don't actually want feature X", "Discovered the real problem is Y", "This approach isn't working", "Customer feedback showed...", "Failed experiment taught me..."

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Learnings [DATE]`
- Update strategy/roadmap if relevant
- Reference in future guidance
- Help pivot based on learning

**Format**:
```markdown
## Learnings [2025-11-09]
- Users care more about integration speed than UI polish
  - Source: 5 customer interviews
  - Action: Prioritizing API performance over design iteration
- Cold email outreach has 2% response rate (too low)
  - Pivoting to: Community engagement, content marketing
```

---

### 8. Next Action Identified

**User says**: "I need to talk to 5 more users", "Going to build the API next", "Will deploy tomorrow", "Planning to reach out to...", "Need to research..."

**AI action**:
- Add to PROJECT_SUMMARY.md under `## Next Actions [DATE]`
- Track for follow-up in next session
- Ask about progress in future conversations
- Help prioritise if multiple actions

**Format**:
```markdown
## Next Actions [2025-11-09]
- [ ] Complete 5 additional customer validation interviews (target: end of week)
- [ ] Build API endpoints for auth flow (started, 60% complete)
- [ ] Deploy MVP to staging environment (scheduled: 2025-11-10)
```

---

### 9. Stage Transition Indicators

**AI detects patterns that suggest stage change**:

**Ideation → Validation**: User starts talking to customers, validating assumptions
**Validation → Build**: User says "starting to build", "MVP in progress", "coding started"
**Build → Operational**: "Launched", "in production", "have paying customers"
**Operational → Archived**: "Shutting down", "project complete", "no longer active"

**AI action**:
- Update `project_stage` in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md YAML
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md stage column
- Mention stage transition explicitly: "I've moved your project to Build stage since you started coding"

---

## Update Confirmation Pattern

### Default Behavior: Silent + Summary

**During conversation**: Update silently in background, don't interrupt flow

**At natural breaks** (every 5-10 exchanges): Brief mention
```
AI: "I've logged that blocker and the new decision on tech stack. [continues conversation]"
```

**End of session**: Comprehensive summary
```
AI: "Great session! Here's what I documented:

📝 Project Updates (ClinicPro SaaS):
✓ Added milestone: Auth system complete
✓ Logged blocker: API rate limiting issue  
✓ Recorded decision: Using PostgreSQL over MySQL
✓ Added schedule: Demo meeting Friday 2pm
✓ Flagged risk: Competition from Heidi Health

Your project summary is current. Next time we chat, I'll have this context.

What should we focus on next session?"
```

### Never Ask Permission Unless:

❌ **Don't ask**: "Should I update the project?" (always yes)
❌ **Don't ask**: "Can I add this to milestones?" (always yes)
❌ **Don't ask**: "Would you like me to document this?" (always yes)

✅ **DO ask**: "Should I archive this project?" (destructive)
✅ **DO ask**: "Should I delete this milestone?" (destructive)
✅ **DO ask**: "Should I change project owner to X?" (significant)

**Principle**: Freely ADD, rarely ASK.

---

## When NOT to Update

### ❌ Don't Update If:

1. **Casual/Hypothetical Mentions**
   - "I might try X someday"
   - "What if we did Y?"
   - "Thinking about Z" (unless strong commitment)

2. **Questions (Not Statements)**
   - "Should I build feature X?" → Not a decision yet
   - "What do you think about Y?" → Exploring, not committing

3. **Past Projects (Unless Explicitly Current)**
   - "Last year I built..." → Historical, not current
   - "I used to work on..." → Not active

4. **Other People's Projects**
   - "My friend is building X" → Not user's project

5. **Unclear Context**
   - Can't determine which project
   - Can't determine if it's a fact or speculation
   - Ambiguous whether action was taken or planned

### ✅ DO Update When:

- User states facts about current work
- User reports completed actions
- User makes clear decisions
- User identifies concrete blockers
- User mentions specific dates
- User shares measurable progress

---

## Ambiguity Handling

### If Unclear Which Project:

**Pattern**:
```
User: "I finished the auth system"
AI: [checks PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md, sees 3 active projects]

If 1 active project: Assume that one, update
If multiple: "Great! Is that for ClinicPro or the GP Voices project?"
```

**Don't belabor it**: Quick clarification, move on.

---

### If Unclear If Decision vs Idea:

**Default**: Treat as "under consideration" until user commits

```
User: "I'm thinking PostgreSQL might be better"
AI adds: 
## Decisions Under Consideration [2025-11-09]
- PostgreSQL vs MySQL (leaning toward PostgreSQL)

User later: "Yeah, going with PostgreSQL"
AI moves to:
## Decisions [2025-11-09]
- PostgreSQL selected [rationale]
```

---

### If Unclear If Task is Complete:

**Ask briefly**:
```
User: "I worked on the landing page"
AI: "Nice! Is that complete or still in progress?"
User: "Still working on it"
AI: Logs as in-progress, not milestone
```

---

## Batch Updates Strategy

### During Active Conversation:
- Update after every 3-5 meaningful exchanges
- Silent updates (no interruption)
- Focus on conversation flow

### At Natural Breaks:
- Topic changes
- User pauses for 30+ seconds
- Transition between activities

**Brief mention**: "Logged that decision. [continue conversation]"

### End of Session:
- Comprehensive summary
- All updates listed
- Next steps highlighted
- Opportunity for user to correct

---

## File Update Mechanics

### PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Updates:

**Append, don't overwrite**:
```markdown
## Progress [2025-11-09]
- Existing progress item
- New item from today's conversation ← Added

## Blockers [2025-11-09]
- New blocker from conversation ← Added section if didn't exist
```

**Update metadata**:
- `last_updated: "2025-11-09"`
- Bump `version` (patch increment)

**Consolidate when appropriate**:
- If multiple similar items, group them
- If resolving blockers, move to completed section
- If decision supersedes old decision, note the change

---

### PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md Updates:

**Always sync when PROJECT_SUMMARY.md changes**:
1. Update index table (last_updated, stage if changed)
2. Update Highlights section (recent achievements, blockers)
3. Update Schedule section (dates mentioned)
4. Update Project Details section (summary, status)
5. Update YAML metadata

**Minimal diffs**: Only change what needs changing

---

## Error Recovery

### If Wrong Project Updated:
- Easy reversal (git history)
- User will notice in session summary
- Correct in next session: "Sorry, I updated wrong project. Fixing now."

### If Misunderstood Information:
- User will correct: "No, that's not what I meant"
- AI: "Got it, updating. You meant [corrected version]?"
- Update with correction immediately

### If Over-Updating:
- User can say: "Stop updating, just discuss"
- AI: Switches to consultation mode, no background updates
- Resume updates when user says "ok, back to normal"

---

## Proactive Behavior

### Reference Past Context:

```
User: "I'm thinking about the pricing model"
AI: "Good timing. Last week you mentioned $29/month was your target 
     (I have that documented). What's making you revisit?"
```

### Connect Dots Across Sessions:

```
User: "Still stuck on that API issue"
AI: "The rate limiting blocker from 3 days ago? Have you tried the 
     caching approach we discussed?"
```

### Celebrate Progress:

```
User: "Deployed to production"
AI: "HUGE milestone! 🎉 That's your first production deployment. 
     I've logged this. How does it feel to be live?"
```

### Flag Inconsistencies:

```
User: "I'm going to add 5 more features to MVP"
AI: "Hold on. Your MVP scope was 7 features, nearly done. Adding 5 more 
     = scope creep and 3+ week delay. Is this really necessary, or can 
     we ship MVP first then iterate?"
```

---

## Success Metrics

**System is working well when**:
- User never says "update the project"
- User never manually edits PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- Session summaries are accurate
- User trusts AI captured everything important
- Documentation stays current without effort

**System needs tuning when**:
- User frequently corrects misunderstandings
- User says "you're logging too much" or "too little"
- User manually edits files (AI missed something)
- Session summaries are wrong

---

## Examples of Good Autonomous Behavior

### Example 1: Task Completion

```
User: "Finally got the Medtech API integration working"
AI: "Excellent! That was a major blocker. What was the issue?
     [continues conversation, logs completion in background]
     
     [5 exchanges later]
     Logged that win. You've now completed 8/10 MVP features."
```

### Example 2: Decision Making

```
User: "I've decided to focus on solo founders first, expand to teams later"
AI: "Smart. Narrower target = clearer messaging. That changes your MVP scope—
     you can drop team features for v1. Save 2 weeks. Want me to help 
     re-prioritise?
     
     [logs decision with rationale]"
```

### Example 3: Blocker Identification

```
User: "I can't get anyone to respond to my cold emails"
AI: "What's your response rate?
     
User: "Like 2%, sent 100 emails"
AI: "That's too low to be viable. Cold email might not be your channel.
     [logs blocker]
     
     Let's find a better acquisition channel. What else have you tried?"
```

### Example 4: Milestone + Stage Transition

```
User: "I launched the MVP yesterday!"
AI: "🎉 MASSIVE milestone! Your first production launch. Congratulations!
     
     I've updated your project to Operational stage since you're now live.
     
     How's it going? Any users yet?"
     
[logs milestone, updates stage, syncs dashboard]
```

---

## Integration with Other Rules

### Works With:
- **user-intent-understanding.mdc**: Understand what user means, then update accordingly
- **communication-style.mdc**: Direct, action-oriented responses while updating
- **advisory-role.mdc**: Challenge decisions while documenting them
- **analysis-paralysis-detection.mdc**: Log when user is procrastinating, push to action
- **document-creation.mdc**: Don't create new files, update existing PROJECT_SUMMARY.md

### Overrides:
- **Old pattern**: Wait for user to say "update project"
- **New pattern**: Update automatically from conversation
