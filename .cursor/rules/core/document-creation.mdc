# Document Creation/Editing Timing - CRITICAL RULE

**🚨 MANDATORY CHECKLIST BEFORE ANY FILE CREATION OR EDITING 🚨**

Before using ANY file creation/editing tool (write, edit_file, search_replace, etc.), you MUST answer ALL of these questions:

0. ✅ **Is the user query CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS?** → If NO, ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST. DO NOT CREATE FILES.
1. ✅ **Is the task/work COMPLETE and FINALIZED?** → If NO, respond in chat only
2. ✅ **Did the user EXPLICITLY ask to save/create/edit a document?** → If NO, respond in chat only  
3. ✅ **Is this a FINAL DELIVERABLE that needs to be saved?** → If NO, respond in chat only
4. ✅ **Is this for FUTURE REFERENCE (not just current discussion)?** → If NO, respond in chat only

**If question 0 is NO → ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. DO NOT CREATE OR EDIT FILES.**
**If ANY other answer is NO → RESPOND IN CHAT ONLY. DO NOT CREATE OR EDIT FILES.**

**PRINCIPLE**: Only create or edit documents/files when a task is accomplished/finished OR when something needs to be saved for future reference. During discussions, planning, or iterative work, respond in chat only - DO NOT create or edit interim/working documents.

**⚠️ COMMON VIOLATIONS TO AVOID:**
- Vague/exploratory queries ("Title: Nov Week 3", "What is X?") → **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST**, then respond in chat only
- Single words or short phrases without context → **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST**
- Ambiguous requests that could mean multiple things → **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST**
- Planning/organizing tasks → Chat response only  
- Research findings during discussion → Chat response only
- Action plans/checklists for future work → Chat response only
- Any query that doesn't explicitly request document creation/editing → Chat response only
- Discussion questions ("Why did you...?", "What needs to change?") → Chat response only, don't edit files

## When to CREATE or EDIT Documents:

✅ **Task Accomplished**: Work is complete and needs to be saved
  - Example: Weekly LinkedIn post is finalized → create post file
  - Example: Feature implementation complete → update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
  - Example: Meeting notes that need future reference → create notes file

✅ **Future Reference Needed**: Information must be preserved for later use
  - Example: Reusable workflow/template → create workflow document
  - Example: Configuration that will be reused → save config file
  - Example: Reference library (mentions, hashtags, etc.) → create reference doc

✅ **User Explicitly Requests**: User asks to save/create a document
  - Example: "Save this as a document" → create document
  - Example: "Create a template for this" → create template

## When NOT to Create or Edit Documents (Respond in Chat Instead):

❌ **During Discussion**: User is asking questions, exploring options, getting feedback
  - Example: "What do you think about X?" → Answer in chat, don't create doc
  - Example: "Show me options" → List options in chat

❌ **Planning/Iterating**: Still working through ideas, refining approach
  - Example: "Let's improve this" → Discuss improvements in chat, don't edit files yet
  - Example: "What should we change?" → Provide suggestions in chat, don't edit files yet

❌ **Draft/Work-in-Progress**: Content is not finalized
  - Example: "Draft a post" → Show draft in chat response
  - Example: "Help me write X" → Write content in chat, don't save until finalized

❌ **Interim Steps**: Part of a larger workflow, not the final output
  - Example: Research findings during discussion → Present in chat
  - Example: Options/alternatives → Show in chat

## Decision Framework:

**⚠️ STOP AND CHECK BEFORE ANY FILE CREATION OR EDITING ⚠️**

The checklist above is MANDATORY. If you're about to create or edit a file, pause and verify ALL 5 questions pass (especially question 0 about query clarity).

**Default Behavior**: When in doubt, respond in chat. Only create or edit documents when clearly needed for future reference or when work is complete.

**Red Flags That Mean "ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST, Then Respond in Chat Only":**
- User query is vague or exploratory ("What is...?", "Tell me about...", single word/title like "Title Nov Week 3")
- Single words or short phrases without sufficient context
- Ambiguous requests that could be interpreted multiple ways
- Query lacks clear action or intent

**Red Flags That Mean "Respond in Chat Only":**
- User is asking questions or exploring options ("Why did you...?", "What needs to change?")
- Content is not finalized or is work-in-progress
- This is planning/organizing, not a completed deliverable
- User hasn't explicitly said "save", "create", "edit", "update", "document", or similar
- User is discussing/exploring before deciding what to change

## Vague Query Handling - CRITICAL:

**When user query is vague, ambiguous, or unclear:**
1. **STOP** - Do not create files, do not make assumptions
2. **ASK** - Request clarification with specific questions
3. **WAIT** - Get user's response before proceeding
4. **THEN** - Act based on clarified intent

**Examples of vague queries that require clarification:**
- Single words or titles: "Title Nov Week 3", "Week 3", "November"
- Short phrases without context: "Improve rules", "Fix this"
- Ambiguous requests: "Do the thing", "Handle it"
- Unclear intent: Queries where you're guessing what the user wants

## Examples:

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Title: Nov Week 3" → AI creates `week-3-action-plan.md`  
**❌ ALSO WRONG**: User says "Title: Nov Week 3" → AI assumes intent and explains in chat  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Title: Nov Week 3" → AI asks: "I need clarification - are you asking me to: (1) create a LinkedIn post template for November Week 3, (2) update an existing document, (3) something else? Please clarify what you'd like me to do."

**❌ WRONG**: User says "What are some title options?" → AI creates `title-options.md`  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "What are some title options?" → AI lists options in chat response

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Help me draft a LinkedIn post" → AI immediately creates `linkedin-post-draft.md`  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Help me draft a LinkedIn post" → AI writes draft in chat. Only create file when user says "Save this" or "I'm done"

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Let's improve the post" → AI creates `improvements.md`  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Let's improve the post" → AI discusses improvements in chat

**❌ WRONG**: User says "What needs to change so it won't happen again?" → AI edits rule file  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "What needs to change so it won't happen again?" → AI discusses changes in chat

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Why did you create the doc?" → AI edits rule file  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Why did you create the doc?" → AI explains in chat, discusses improvements

**❌ WRONG**: User says "What needs to be done for Week 3?" → AI creates action plan document  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "What needs to be done for Week 3?" → AI lists tasks in chat response

**✅ CORRECT**: User says "I'm done with this week's post" → AI creates final post file  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Create a reusable workflow" → AI creates workflow document  
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Save this as a document" → AI creates document  
**✅ CORRECT**: Task complete (e.g., post published) → AI updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
