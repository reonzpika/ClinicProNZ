# Document Creation Timing - CRITICAL RULE

**PRINCIPLE**: Only create documents/files when a task is accomplished/finished OR when something needs to be saved for future reference. During discussions, planning, or iterative work, respond in chat only - DO NOT create interim/working documents.

## When to CREATE Documents:

✅ **Task Accomplished**: Work is complete and needs to be saved
  - Example: Weekly LinkedIn post is finalized → create post file
  - Example: Feature implementation complete → update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
  - Example: Meeting notes that need future reference → create notes file

✅ **Future Reference Needed**: Information must be preserved for later use
  - Example: Reusable workflow/template → create workflow document
  - Example: Configuration that will be reused → save config file
  - Example: Reference library (mentions, hashtags, etc.) → create reference doc

✅ **User Explicitly Requests**: User asks to save/create a document
  - Example: "Save this as a document" → create document
  - Example: "Create a template for this" → create template

## When NOT to Create Documents (Respond in Chat Instead):

❌ **During Discussion**: User is asking questions, exploring options, getting feedback
  - Example: "What do you think about X?" → Answer in chat, don't create doc
  - Example: "Show me options" → List options in chat

❌ **Planning/Iterating**: Still working through ideas, refining approach
  - Example: "Let's improve this" → Discuss improvements in chat
  - Example: "What should we change?" → Provide suggestions in chat

❌ **Draft/Work-in-Progress**: Content is not finalized
  - Example: "Draft a post" → Show draft in chat response
  - Example: "Help me write X" → Write content in chat, don't save until finalized

❌ **Interim Steps**: Part of a larger workflow, not the final output
  - Example: Research findings during discussion → Present in chat
  - Example: Options/alternatives → Show in chat

## Decision Framework:

Before creating ANY document, ask:
1. **Is the task/work complete?** → If NO, respond in chat
2. **Does this need to be saved for future reference?** → If NO, respond in chat
3. **Did the user explicitly ask to save/create?** → If NO, respond in chat
4. **Is this a final deliverable?** → If NO, respond in chat

**Default Behavior**: When in doubt, respond in chat. Only create documents when clearly needed for future reference or when work is complete.

## Examples:

**❌ WRONG**: User says "What are some title options?" → AI creates `title-options.md`
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "What are some title options?" → AI lists options in chat response

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Help me draft a LinkedIn post" → AI immediately creates `linkedin-post-draft.md`
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Help me draft a LinkedIn post" → AI writes draft in chat. Only create file when user says "Save this" or "I'm done"

**❌ WRONG**: User says "Let's improve the post" → AI creates `improvements.md`
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Let's improve the post" → AI discusses improvements in chat

**✅ CORRECT**: User says "I'm done with this week's post" → AI creates final post file
**✅ CORRECT**: User says "Create a reusable workflow" → AI creates workflow document
**✅ CORRECT**: Task complete (e.g., post published) → AI updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
