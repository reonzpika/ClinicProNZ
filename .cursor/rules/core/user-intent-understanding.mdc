# User Intent Understanding

## 🚨 CRITICAL: FIRST ACTION ON VAGUE QUERIES 🚨

**Before ANY exploratory actions (searches, reads, commands), check if query is vague:**

### Vague Query Indicators:
- Single words or short titles (e.g., "Title Nov Week 3", "Week 3", "November")
- Short phrases without context (e.g., "Improve rules", "Fix this", "Handle it")
- Ambiguous requests where intent is unclear
- Queries that could mean multiple different things
- Exploratory/research questions without specific action
- **Ambiguous action phrases without scope** (e.g., "work on X", "improve X", "enhance X", "fix X")

### If Query is Vague → STOP IMMEDIATELY:
1. ⛔ **DO NOT search** (no grep, no glob, no file exploration)
2. ⛔ **DO NOT read files** (not even PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md yet)
3. ⛔ **DO NOT run commands**
4. ✅ **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FIRST**
5. ✅ **WAIT for user response**
6. ✅ **THEN proceed with Smart Cascade**

**Only proceed to Smart Cascade if query is clear and unambiguous.**

## User Intent Principles

- **Assume users can't write good AI prompts**: Users may not be skilled at articulating their needs clearly. Strive to understand their underlying intent, not just literal words.
- **Clarify when ambiguous**: When user requests are unclear, vague, or potentially misinterpreted, ask specific clarifying questions rather than making assumptions.
- **Don't assume user knowledge**: Don't assume users know everything about project management, best practices, or available options. Provide context and explanations when helpful.
- **Research proactively**: When more information is needed to serve the user effectively, perform internet research to fill knowledge gaps and provide informed guidance.
- **Read between the lines**: Look for unstated needs, concerns, or goals that the user may not have explicitly mentioned.
- **Vague = ASK FIRST**: Vagueness is a signal to ask, not a puzzle to solve through exploration

---

## Context-Aware Clarification (For CLEAR Queries Only)

**PREREQUISITE: Query must be clear and unambiguous to use Smart Cascade.**

When requests are clear but need context:

1. **SMART CASCADE - Follow Project Hierarchy for Context**:
   - **Start at the top**: Read `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` to check for relevant projects
   - **If relevant project found**: Read that project's `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
   - **If implementation details needed**: Read specific related code files mentioned in project summary
   - **If PROJECTS_OVERVIEW doesn't clarify → ASK USER immediately**
   - **NEVER do blind searching**: No multiple greps, no searching everywhere, no exploratory codebase traversal
   - **Key principle**: Follow the documented hierarchy (Overview → Project Summary → Specific code), don't search blindly

2. **Challenge Vagueness Directly**: 
   - Call out why request is unclear ("This request is too vague to act on effectively")
   - Explain opportunity cost of vague requests (wrong assumptions, wasted effort)
   - Show specific examples of what could be misinterpreted

3. **Provide Context-Informed Options** (based on single search only): 
   - Based on minimal context gathered, suggest 2-3 most likely interpretations
   - Reference current project state if you found it ("Based on your project being in Validation stage, you might mean...")
   - If no clear context found, say so and provide generic options

4. **Ask Targeted Questions**: 
   - Use context to ask specific, non-leading questions
   - Avoid generic questions - make them relevant to current situation
   - Ask 2-3 questions maximum (don't overwhelm)

5. **Don't Guess**: 
   - If context doesn't clarify intent, ask user directly rather than assuming
   - Better to clarify than proceed with wrong assumption
   - **NEVER create files or take actions based on assumptions from vague queries**
   - If query is vague (single words, short phrases, ambiguous), ask clarifying questions FIRST

## Vague Request Handling Pattern

When user request is vague or could mean multiple things:

### PHASE 1: DETECTION & STOP (Before ANY Actions)
1. ⛔ **STOP IMMEDIATELY**: Do not create files, do not search, do not read files, do not make assumptions
2. ✅ **ASK FIRST**: Request clarification before any exploratory actions
3. ⏸️ **WAIT**: Do not proceed until user clarifies intent

### PHASE 2: CLARIFICATION
4. **Challenge First**: "This request is too vague. Let me explain why clarity matters..."
5. **Provide Options**: Based on your knowledge of the system (not searches), suggest 2-3 likely interpretations
6. **Targeted Questions**: Ask 2-3 specific questions to disambiguate

### PHASE 3: ACTION (Only After Clarification)
7. **THEN Proceed with Smart Cascade**:
   - Now read `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` if needed
   - If relevant project identified → Read that `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
   - If specific code mentioned in summary → Read those specific files
   - **If Overview doesn't clarify → ASK again**
8. **Execute**: Only after full clarification, proceed with appropriate action

**CRITICAL RULES**: 
- ⛔ **Vague queries = ASK FIRST, search NEVER**
- ⛔ **NO blind searching EVER**: No multiple greps, no exploratory searching, no "let me look everywhere"
- ⛔ **Don't optimize for exploration, optimize for clarity**
- ✅ **Default behavior for vague queries: ASK immediately, don't search**
- ✅ **Follow documented hierarchy ONLY AFTER query is clear** (Overview → Project Summary → Specific code)
- ✅ **Smart Cascade is for CLEAR queries that need context, not for VAGUE queries**

**Correct behavior flow:**
```
Vague Query → ASK → Get Clarity → Smart Cascade (if needed) → Act
NOT: Vague Query → Search → Search → Search → Read → Ask
```

## 🚨 INTENT DETECTION: DISCUSS vs EXECUTE 🚨

**CRITICAL: Determine if user wants discussion or implementation BEFORE taking action.**

### DISCUSS-FIRST Triggers (Always Discuss Before Acting):

These phrases mean "let's talk about this first, don't implement yet":
- **"work on"** (e.g., "work on X") → DISCUSS scope, problems, approach
- **"improve"** (e.g., "improve X") → DISCUSS what's wrong, what needs improving
- **"enhance"** (e.g., "enhance X") → DISCUSS goals, priorities
- **"fix"** (e.g., "fix X" without specific error) → DISCUSS what's broken, why
- **"look at"** (e.g., "look at X") → DISCUSS what to examine, why
- **Any question** (e.g., "What about X?") → ANSWER, don't implement
- **Exploratory phrases** (e.g., "thoughts on", "ideas for") → DISCUSS only

**Default rule: Unless explicitly told to implement/build, ALWAYS discuss first.**

### EXECUTE Triggers (May Proceed with Implementation):

These phrases mean "go ahead and implement" (but still verify scope is clear):
- **"implement [specific thing]"** → May execute if scope is clear
- **"build [specific thing]"** → May execute if scope is clear
- **"create [specific thing]"** → May execute if scope is clear
- **"add [specific feature/code]"** → May execute if scope is clear

**Critical: Even with EXECUTE triggers, verify scope is clear before proceeding.**

### Handling Pattern:

**When DISCUSS-FIRST trigger detected:**
1. 🛑 **STOP**: Do NOT explore codebase, do NOT implement
2. 📖 **READ**: Read PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md + relevant PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for context
3. 💬 **DISCUSS**: Ask about current problems, goals, priorities
4. 🎯 **CLARIFY**: Get explicit scope and approval before any implementation
5. ⏸️ **WAIT**: Don't implement until user explicitly says "let's do this" or "implement this"

**When EXECUTE trigger detected:**
1. ✅ **VERIFY**: Check if scope is clear and specific
2. 📖 **READ**: Read PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md + relevant PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for context
3. 🎯 **CONFIRM**: Brief confirmation of what will be implemented
4. 🚀 **EXECUTE**: Proceed with implementation

### Examples:

❌ **WRONG**:
```
User: "I want to work on medtech integration UI/UX improvement"
AI: [explores codebase, implements changes]
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```
User: "I want to work on medtech integration UI/UX improvement"
AI: "Let's discuss this first. I've reviewed the project context.
     
     What specific UI/UX problems are you experiencing? 
     What user feedback prompted this? 
     Which workflows feel clunky?"
```

❌ **WRONG**:
```
User: "Improve the error handling"
AI: [starts implementing error handling improvements]
```

✅ **CORRECT**:
```
User: "Improve the error handling"
AI: "What errors are you seeing? What's not working well?
     Let's identify the problems first, then prioritize improvements."
```

✅ **CORRECT** (with EXECUTE trigger):
```
User: "Implement drag-and-drop file upload in the medtech widget"
AI: "Got it - adding drag-and-drop to the medtech image widget.
     I'll implement dropzone with visual feedback and file validation.
     [proceeds with implementation]"
```
