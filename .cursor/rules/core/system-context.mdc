# System Context

**System Overview**: Multi-project management system where:
- `/project-management/PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` - Global dashboard (mission control for all projects)
- `/project-management/[project-name]/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Single source of truth per project (mandatory for each project)

**Rule Files**: Follow `.cursor/rules/core/current-task.mdc` for operational workflow. Reference `.cursor/rules/project-management/core-principles.mdc` for detailed policies. Communication fundamentals (style, NZ localization, user intent) are always active.

**Technical Rules**: ClinicPro-specific technical rules coexist with project management rules:
- `.cursor/rules/technical/debugging-strategy.mdc` - Technical debugging approach

**🛑 FILE OPERATIONS - CRITICAL REMINDER 🛑**
Before ANY Write/Edit/Delete tool:
1. Use `<thinking>` block to check `.cursor/rules/core/document-creation.mdc` checklist
2. Creating FILE #2+ in one session? → STOP - likely violation (unless user explicitly requested each)
3. During testing/exploration? → Report in chat, DON'T create interim docs
