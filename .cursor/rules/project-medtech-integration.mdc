# Medtech Integration Project Rules (Project Management Layer)

## Purpose
Ensure documentation and testing notes for Medtech Integration remain accurate and operationally useful.
This file complements the global project-management rules and the project’s own `PROJECT_RULES.md`.

## Canonical facility usage
- Hosted UAT API testing: `F2N060-E`.
- Local Medtech Evolution UI validation: `F99669-C` (requires Windows desktop tunnel staying awake).

## Key invariants
- Only the Lightsail BFF (static IP allow-listed) should call ALEX directly.
- Record ALEX anomalies with direct evidence (status codes, OperationOutcome snippets, correlation IDs).

## Documentation placement
- Current state and next pick-up point: `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`.
- Evidence, experiments, and comms: `LOG.md` (chronological).
- Legacy history: `CHANGELOG.md` exists; do not duplicate its content into `LOG.md`. New work goes into `LOG.md`.
