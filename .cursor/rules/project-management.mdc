# Project Management Documentation System

## Purpose
Keep project management docs low-duplication and fast to rehydrate at the start of a new chat.
Root docs are overview and current work; project folders hold detail and evidence.

## Canonical documents

### Root level (`/project-management/`)
- `CURRENT-WORK.md`: current priorities, active task queue, constraints, and metrics (NO HISTORY).
- `PORTFOLIO.md`: project list, one-line status per project, and navigation pointers.
- `2026-ANNUAL-PLANNING.md`: company-wide goals and kill signals (read only for strategic/quarterly work).

Legacy files may exist for backward compatibility:
- `CURRENT-FOCUS.md` (deprecated; points to `CURRENT-WORK.md`)
- `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` (deprecated; points to `PORTFOLIO.md`)

### Per-project folder (`/project-management/<project>/`)
- `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: current status, next session pick-up point, and short plan (NOT chronological, NO HISTORY).
- `LOG.md`: chronological log with evidence and decisions (ALL HISTORY GOES HERE).

## Read order (by intent)
- Session start, what to work on: `CURRENT-WORK.md`, then `PORTFOLIO.md`.
- Status of a specific project: that project's `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`.
- What happened and why (evidence): that project's `LOG.md` (latest entries first).

## Anti-duplication policy (strict)
- **Current status** lives in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` only (where we are NOW, what's blocking, what's next).
- **Chronological narrative and evidence** live in `LOG.md` only (what happened, when, why, with evidence).
- **NO HISTORY in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md or CURRENT-WORK.md** - these are current state only.
- Root docs must not repeat project detail; use pointers to `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` or `LOG.md`.
- Do not paste logs or past achievements into summaries; all history goes to LOG.md.

## Update workflow (approval-gated)

### When the user explicitly requests documentation changes
Update immediately.

### When you notice a meaningful milestone, blocker change, or decision
Propose updates first and ask for approval:

**Standard update (most work):**
1. `project-management/<project>/LOG.md`: detailed chronological entry (what happened, evidence, decisions)
2. `project-management/<project>/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: update current status/next action/blockers only

**Rarely needed:**
3. `project-management/PORTFOLIO.md`: only if project status changed significantly (e.g., launched, paused, cancelled)

**Almost never:**
4. `project-management/CURRENT-WORK.md`: only during weekly planning or when priorities shift

Then ask: "Should I proceed with these updates?"
Do not edit files until approved.

**Rule: Most updates should touch 2 files max (LOG.md + PROJECT_SUMMARY.md).**

## Style
- NZ English spelling.
- Concise, bullet-first.
- No em dashes; use full stops or semicolons.
- Dates: `YYYY-MM-DD DDD` (example: `2026-01-10 Fri`).
