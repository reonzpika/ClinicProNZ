# Project Work Rules

**Read this when opening PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - These rules guide how to work on projects.

**Context**: You're reading this because you opened a PROJECT_SUMMARY.md file. You now have project context loaded.

## Part 1: Work Workflow

### The Pattern: Discuss → Approve → Implement → Update

**Step 1: Discuss First**
- User says "work on X", "improve Y", "fix Z" → DISCUSS, don't implement yet
- Ask about current problems, goals, priorities
- Understand scope and constraints
- Stay in chat, don't touch code yet

**Step 2: Suggest Approach**
- When plan is clear, suggest specific implementation
- Explain trade-offs if relevant
- Keep it concise - 2-3 options max

**Step 3: Wait for Approval**
- User says "yes, do it", "go ahead", "implement" → Proceed
- User says "let me think" or asks more questions → Back to discussion
- Don't implement on assumption

**Step 4: Implement Changes**
- Make the agreed changes
- Stay focused on approved plan
- Don't add extras without asking

**Step 5: Update Documentation**
- After implementation complete → Update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- Log what was done, decisions made, learnings
- Update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md if significant

### Exception: Explicit Instructions

If user says "implement X", "build Y", "create Z" with clear specific scope:
- Read project context first
- Briefly confirm what you'll do
- Proceed with implementation
- Update docs after completion

## Validation Checklist

Before ending session, verify:
- ✅ Did I discuss before implementing code changes?
- ✅ Did I wait for approval before implementing?
- ✅ Did I update PROJECT_SUMMARY.md after completion?
- ✅ If PROJECT_SUMMARY.md changed, did I update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md?
- ✅ Did I avoid creating interim documents during discussions?
- ✅ Are all new files referenced in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md?
