# Project Work Rules

**Context**: These rules are always loaded and guide how to work on projects. Follow the workflow below for all project-related work.

---

## Part 1: Work Workflow

### The Pattern: Discuss → Approve → Implement → Update

**Step 1: Discuss First**
- User says "work on X", "improve Y", "fix Z" → DISCUSS, don't implement yet
- Ask about current problems, goals, priorities
- Understand scope and constraints
- Stay in chat, don't touch code yet

**Step 2: Suggest Approach**
- When plan is clear, suggest specific implementation
- Explain trade-offs if relevant
- Keep it concise - 2-3 options max

**Step 3: Wait for Approval**
- User says "yes, do it", "go ahead", "implement" → Proceed
- User says "let me think" or asks more questions → Back to discussion
- Don't implement on assumption

**Step 4: Implement Changes**
- Make the agreed changes
- Stay focused on approved plan
- Don't add extras without asking

**Step 5: Update Documentation (When Appropriate)**
- Update docs only when:
  - Major task/project milestone completed
  - User explicitly asks for doc updates
  - Session is ending and significant work was done
- Don't update docs after every small change
- Log decisions in CHANGELOG.md (not scattered session summaries)

### Exception: Explicit Instructions

If user says "implement X", "build Y", "create Z" with clear specific scope:
- Read project context first
- Briefly confirm what you'll do
- Proceed with implementation
- Update docs after completion

## Part 2: Documentation Rules

### Consolidation First

**Before creating any new file, ask**:
1. Can this content fit in an existing document?
2. Is this temporary (exploration) or permanent (reference)?
3. Will AI need to see this without being explicitly told?

**Prefer consolidation**:
- ✅ Add to existing PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- ✅ Add to existing FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md
- ✅ Add section to existing reference doc
- ✅ Log changes in CHANGELOG.md (not session summaries)
- ❌ Don't create new file for small content (<500 words)
- ❌ Don't create new file unless it has clear ongoing purpose
- ❌ Don't create README.md files (use PROJECT_SUMMARY.md instead)

### New File Requirements

**If you must create a new file**:
1. **Reference it immediately** in the main doc AI will see:
   - Add link in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (if project-level doc)
   - Add link in FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md (if feature-level doc)
2. **Document why it's separate** (e.g., "Detailed 10,000-word spec too long for overview")
3. **Use descriptive names** (e.g., `mobile-ui-spec.md` not `mobile.md` or `README.md`)

### AI Context Awareness

**Critical**: Documents in subfolders are invisible to AI unless:
- Referenced in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md or FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md
- Explicitly opened by user
- Listed in navigation instructions (PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md)

**Default locations AI sees**:
- PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md (always)
- PROJECT_SUMMARY.md (when matched to project)
- Files referenced in those two docs

**Therefore**:
- Important decisions → PROJECT_SUMMARY.md or CHANGELOG.md
- Large detailed specs → Separate file + reference in summary
- Temporary exploration → Chat only, no file creation

## Validation Checklist

Before ending session, verify:
- ✅ Did I discuss before implementing code changes?
- ✅ Did I wait for approval before implementing?
- ✅ Did I consolidate into existing docs instead of creating new files?
- ✅ Are all new files referenced in PROJECT_SUMMARY.md or FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md?
- ✅ Did I avoid creating session summaries or temporary docs?
- ✅ Did I only update docs for major milestones (not every small change)?
- ✅ If PROJECT_SUMMARY.md changed significantly, did I update PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md?

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Never Use Em Dashes (—)

**Rule:** NEVER use em dashes (—) in any documents. They are strongly associated with AI-generated content.

**Instead, use:**
- Semicolons (;) for contrasting or clarifying clauses
- Commas (,) for additional information
- Periods (.) to separate sentences
- Parentheses () for explanatory notes
- "and" to connect phrases naturally
- Question marks (?) to separate questions

**Bad:** `The system is strictly assist-only—never provides diagnostic directives.`  
**Good:** `The system is strictly assist-only; it never provides diagnostic directives.`

**Bad:** `Research will follow evidence—investigation may discover novel patterns.`  
**Good:** `Research will follow evidence. Investigation may discover novel patterns.`
