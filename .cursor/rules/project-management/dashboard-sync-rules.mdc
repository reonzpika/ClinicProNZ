# Dashboard Synchronization Rules

## Dashboard Purpose
**PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md**: Mission control dashboard - immediate snapshot, onboarding, cross-project visibility

## Structure
- Active Projects Index (name, folder, stage, owner, last updated, link to `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)
- AI-Generated Highlights (achievements, blockers, cross-project themes)
- Quick Status Summary (counts by stage)
- Schedule (upcoming and past events: meetings, appointments, deadlines, milestones, due dates)
- Project Details (brief per project: dates, status, summary)
- Archived Projects

## Update Triggers
**ALWAYS** update dashboard when:
- Any update to `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (metadata, content, status, milestones, risks, summary)
- New project creation
- Stage change
- Archiving
- Major milestones
- Blockers identified
- Owner change
- Significant status updates
- Project summary changes
- Risk status changes
- **Schedule Items**: When dates, appointments, meetings, deadlines, or due dates are mentioned in project updates, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, or user communications

## Update Process
1. Update index table
2. Refresh highlights
3. Update status counts
4. **Update Schedule section** (add/update/remove events)
5. Update project details
6. Update YAML `last_updated`
7. Validate links

## Schedule Management

**When to Add**: Add to Schedule section when dates/appointments are mentioned in:
- Project updates or `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` changes
- User communications mentioning meetings, deadlines, due dates, appointments
- Milestone dates, project start/end dates, submission deadlines
- Any time-bound commitments or events

**Format**: Use table format with columns: Date, Time (if applicable), Event, Project, Type (Meeting/Milestone/Deadline/Action), Notes

**Organization**: 
- "Upcoming Events" table: Future dates sorted chronologically (earliest first)
- "Past Events" table: Completed dates sorted chronologically (most recent first)
- Move items from "Upcoming" to "Past" when date has passed

**Types**: Meeting, Milestone, Deadline, Action, Appointment, Submission, Review, etc.

**Maintenance**: 
- Automatically extract dates from project updates
- Include project context (which project the event belongs to)
- Remove or archive past events older than 3 months (optional, keep if historically significant)
- Update Schedule section whenever dates are mentioned, even if not explicitly requested

## Consistency and Synchronization

**MANDATORY**: When `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` is updated, `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` MUST be updated in the same task/workflow

- Update `last_updated` and bump `version` (patch) in both `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` and `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`
- Keep dashboard in sync with status/stage, milestones, blockers, achievements
- Reflect decisions/milestones immediately in both files
- Surface cross-project dependencies in dashboard highlights
- Ensure dashboard provides accurate at-a-glance visibility
- **Validation Check**: Before completing any task that modified `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, verify `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` has been updated
