# PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Management

## Requirement
Always required, non-negotiable. Living source-of-truth for all project info.

## Content
Overview, goals, milestones, tasks, decisions, links, status, insights, learnings, progress updates

## Maintenance
Update atomically, use date tags (`## Updates [2024-01-15]`), consolidate related info, prompt before overwriting/deleting significant info

## Validation
If missing, create immediately using template. Ensure present and current before completing work.

## Document Reference Requirement

**CRITICAL**: When creating ANY new document/file in a project directory (action plans, guides, emails, status docs, etc.), it MUST be referenced in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`

**Why**: AI reads `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` first; unreferenced files may be missed in future sessions

**Where to Reference**: Add to "Resources & References" section or relevant context section (e.g., "Action Plan: See `FILENAME.md`")

**Format**: Use clear descriptive links: `[Description](./FILENAME.md)` or `See FILENAME.md for [purpose]`

**Validation**: Before completing any task that created new files, verify they're referenced in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`

**Exception**: Only code files, config files, and standard project files (package.json, etc.) don't need explicit references

## File and Folder Updates
- **Missing PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Critical error - create immediately before proceeding
- **Missing Folders**: Consult user, reference templates, create adaptively
- **Document Creation**: Avoid new docs unless substantially new. Consolidate into `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` when in doubt.
- **Updates**: Minimal diffs, consolidate with date tags, use kebab-case naming
- **Confirmations**: Prompt before overwriting/deleting significant info, renames, deletions, cross-project moves

## Standard Documentation Formats

### Cross-Project Dependencies
**Location**: Document in both projects' `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` under `## Dependencies` section

**Format**:
```markdown
## Dependencies [2024-01-15]

### Outgoing Dependencies
- **[Project Name]** - [Type: Data/Resource/Integration/API] - [Description] - [Status: Active/Blocked/Resolved]

### Incoming Dependencies  
- **[Project Name]** depends on this project for [Description] - [Status: Active/Blocked/Resolved]

### Notes
[Any additional context about dependencies]
```

**Update Process**: When dependency identified:
1. Update both projects' `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` with dependency info
2. Update `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` Cross-Project Themes & Dependencies section
3. Date-stamp the dependency entry
4. Update dashboard highlights if dependency affects project status

### Consolidated Information Structure
When consolidating scattered information into `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`:

**Format**: `## [Topic] [Date]`

**Organization**:
- Group by topic: Goals, Decisions, Learnings, Risks, Blockers, Insights, Updates
- Date-stamp each entry
- Maintain chronological order within sections
- Preserve original context/source if relevant: `[Source: filename.md]`

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
## Decisions [2024-01-15]

### Technology Stack Decision [2024-01-10]
[Decision details] - [Rationale] - [Source: tech-meeting-notes.md]

### Pricing Model Decision [2024-01-12]
[Decision details] - [Rationale] - [Source: business-planning.md]
