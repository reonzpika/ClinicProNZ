# Core Principles

## 🚨 PROJECT NAME REGISTRY 🚨

**CRITICAL: When user mentions these terms, they are referring to PROJECTS (not just code features).**

**Active Projects** (each has PROJECT_SUMMARY.md that MUST be read before any work):

| User Says | Project Folder | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| "medtech" / "medtech integration" / "ALEX" | `medtech-integration` | Read `/project-management/medtech-integration/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` |
| "clinicpro" / "clinic pro" / "saas" | `clinicpro` | Read `/project-management/clinicpro/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` |
| "gp voices" / "community" / "discourse" | `gp-voices-community` | Read `/project-management/gp-voices-community/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` |
| "r&d grant" / "grant" / "callaghan" | `new_to_r&d_grant` | Read `/project-management/new_to_r&d_grant/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` |
| "project management saas" / "pm saas" | `project-management-ai-saas` | Read `/project-management/project-management-ai-saas/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` |

**Rule: Before touching ANY files related to these projects, you MUST:**
1. Read `/project-management/PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` first
2. Read the relevant `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` second
3. Understand project context (stage, goals, blockers, progress)
4. THEN discuss or implement (based on user intent)

**❌ NEVER do this:**
- Hear "medtech" → immediately explore codebase
- Hear "improve X" → immediately implement changes
- Touch project files without reading PROJECT_SUMMARY.md first

**✅ ALWAYS do this:**
- Hear "medtech" → Read PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md + medtech-integration/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md → Then discuss/act
- Hear "work on X" → Read project context → Discuss scope/problems → Wait for approval → Then implement

## Quick Reference - Critical Rules
1. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md REQUIRED**: Every project MUST have `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - create immediately if missing
2. **Single Source of Truth**: `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` = global dashboard; `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` = project truth
3. **MANDATORY SYNC**: If `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` is updated, `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` MUST be updated in the same task - NEVER skip this
4. **Document Creation Timing**: Only create documents when task is complete OR future reference needed. During discussions/planning, respond in chat only - DO NOT create interim/working documents.
5. **User Intent**: Assume users can't write good prompts - understand intent, clarify ambiguities, research proactively
6. **DISCUSS-FIRST Default**: Unless explicitly told to implement/build, ALWAYS discuss before acting. "Work on", "improve", "enhance", "fix" = discuss first.
7. **Template-Driven**: Auto-select templates, load on-demand only, adapt folder structures
8. **Update Dashboard**: After ANY `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` change, update `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` with highlights and status

## Core Principles
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Mandatory**: Every project folder MUST have exactly one `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (living source-of-truth). Create immediately if missing.
- **Single Source of Truth**: `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` = global dashboard; `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` = project canonical record
- **Autonomous Updates**: AI continuously updates PROJECT_SUMMARY.md from natural conversation. User talks about project → AI extracts trackable info → Updates happen in background. User never needs to manually edit project files. Documentation is a byproduct of conversation, not a separate activity.
- **Conversational Listening**: AI actively listens for: task completions, blockers, decisions, dates, milestones, risks, learnings, next actions. Extract and document automatically from natural conversation flow.
- **User Intent Understanding**: Follow guidelines in communication rules - understand underlying intent, clarify ambiguities, research proactively, don't assume knowledge.
- **Document Consolidation**: Avoid new documents unless substantially new. Consolidate into `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` with date tags.
- **Template-First**: Use `/Templates/` for new projects. Auto-select based on stage/type. Load on-demand only.
- **Traceability**: Date-stamp all significant changes. Update `last_updated` and bump `version` (patch).

## Rules of Thumb

### When to Research vs. Ask User
- **Research**: Industry standards, best practices, common patterns, typical approaches, market data
- **Ask User**: Project-specific details, preferences, constraints, team capabilities, business context

### When to Create New Document vs. Consolidate
- **New Document**: Substantially new topic unrelated to existing content, different domain/function
- **Consolidate**: Related information, updates, variations of same topic, refinements
- **MANDATORY**: If creating new document, MUST reference it in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`

### Template Selection Confidence
- **High confidence (>80% keyword match)**: Auto-select immediately, explain reasoning briefly
- **Medium confidence (50-80%)**: Auto-select but explain reasoning, offer to adjust if needed
- **Low confidence (<50%)**: Research project type first, then select or generate, explain process

### Dashboard Update Frequency
- **Immediate**: Stage changes, major milestones, project creation/archiving, blocker identification, **schedule items** (dates/appointments/deadlines)
- **Can Defer**: Minor updates can batch, update on next major change (unless user specifically requests immediate update)
- **Schedule Updates**: Always update Schedule section immediately when dates/appointments/deadlines are mentioned - don't wait for other updates

## Error Handling
- **Missing PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: Critical - create immediately using template
- **Unclear user intent**: Follow communication guidelines - don't assume, use context-aware clarification, research context
- **Ambiguous project selection**: Check PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md, list options, ask user to specify
- **Missing/invalid metadata**: Prompt for exact fields needed, don't assume users know requirements
- **Conflicting information**: Surface conflict, ask for resolution, update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- **Template not found**: Auto-generate template, update index
- **Information scattered**: Consolidate into `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` using standard formats
- **Knowledge gaps**: Research proactively rather than asking user

## Safeguards
- Never work on project without `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - verify first, create if missing
- Never create multiple sources of truth - `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` is single source per project
- Freely ADD information from conversation (not destructive, always safe)
- Freely CONSOLIDATE information (safe operation, improves organization)
- Only CONFIRM when truly destructive: deleting milestones, archiving projects, removing decisions, changing project ownership
- Keep edits scoped - avoid cross-project edits unless explicit
- Always update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` to reflect latest state - living document updated continuously from conversation
- **NEVER update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` without updating `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`** - these files must stay synchronized
- **NEVER create new documents/files without referencing them in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`** - AI relies on PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for context
- After conversations, verify: 
  1. "Did I extract trackable information from conversation?"
  2. "Did I update `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`? If yes, did I also update `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`?"
  3. "Did I summarize updates at end of session?"
