# Project Creation Workflow

## Project Creation Steps

1. **Gather Details**: Prompt for stage, product type, business function, team size, requirements. Infer if sparse, ask clarifying questions.
2. **Create Directory**: Use kebab-case naming
3. **Create PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: IMMEDIATELY (mandatory)
4. **Select Template**: Auto-select based on stage/type
5. **Populate PROJECT_SUMMARY.md**: From template with required YAML
6. **Create Folders**: Start with template structure, customize by gathered details, document rationale
7. **Update Dashboard**: Add row to `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`

## Research and Data Gathering

- **Follow communication principles**: Reference communication rules for user intent understanding guidelines
- **Research proactively**: Conduct internet research to fill gaps, inform decisions
- **When researching**: Indicate sources, date-stamp findings

## Operational Loop

1. Validate context - ask if unclear
2. **Document Creation Check**: Before creating ANY document, verify it meets "When to CREATE Documents" criteria. If not, respond in chat instead.
3. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md Check**: Verify exists, create if missing (CRITICAL)
4. **Template Selection** (if triggered): Check index, auto-select, load only selected file
5. **Template Usage** (if loaded): Use Key Questions, prompt for details, create adaptive folders, consolidate into `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
6. **Research**: If info incomplete, research proactively
7. Validate metadata in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
8. Plan edits - prefer updating `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` and `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` directly
9. Prompt before destructive changes
10. Apply edits atomically, update metadata, date-stamp
11. **MANDATORY Document Reference Check**: If ANY new documents/files were created in project directory:
    - Verify they are referenced in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (Resources & References section or relevant context)
    - Add reference if missing (critical for AI context awareness)
    - Exception: Code/config files don't need explicit references
12. **MANDATORY Dashboard Update**: If `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` was modified, update `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`:
    - Update index table (name, stage, owner, last_updated)
    - Refresh highlights (achievements, blockers, risks)
    - Update status counts
    - **Update Schedule section** (extract and add any dates/appointments/deadlines mentioned)
    - Update project details section (summary, key dates, status, risks)
    - Update YAML `last_updated` and bump version
    - Validate links
13. Final validation: Ensure `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` reflects all changes AND `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` is synchronized
14. Summarize changes (mention both files if both were updated, mention any new documents created)

## Validation Checkpoints

- **After Step 7**: Verify `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` has required YAML fields (if exists)
- **After Step 4**: Verify template was loaded correctly (if applicable)
- **After Step 10**: Verify metadata updates are valid (semver format, ISO date, valid stage enum)
- **After Step 11**: **CRITICAL CHECK** - If new documents/files were created:
  - Verify they are referenced in `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (Resources & References or relevant section)
  - Add reference if missing (prevents AI missing context in future sessions)
- **After Step 12**: **CRITICAL CHECK** - If `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` was modified, verify `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` was updated:
  - Check that index table reflects latest `last_updated` date
  - Verify project details section matches `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` summary/metadata
  - Confirm highlights section includes recent changes
  - Validate dashboard YAML `last_updated` matches or is newer than `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- **After Step 13**: Final validation - all changes reflected, no inconsistencies between files, dashboard synchronized, all new documents referenced

## Decision Tree: Ambiguous Project Selection

When user says "my project" or project name is unclear:
1. Check `PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md` Active Projects Index
2. If 1 active project: Confirm project name with user ("Assuming you mean [Project Name]?")
3. If multiple active projects: List projects with brief context (stage, last updated), ask user to specify
4. If no active projects: Check archived projects, ask if reviving archived project
5. If still unclear: Ask for project folder name or key identifier
