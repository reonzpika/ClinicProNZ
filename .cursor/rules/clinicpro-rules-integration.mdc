# ClinicPro Rules Integration Guide

## Overview

This workspace uses a **dual rule system** combining:
1. **NexWave Project Management Rules** - Multi-project tracking and documentation
2. **ClinicPro Technical Rules** - Code development and technical workflows

## Rule Sets

### NexWave Project Management Rules
**Scope**: Project management, documentation, templates, multi-project tracking

**Files**:
- `ai-character.mdc` - Advisor role, communication style, user intent understanding
- `current-task.mdc` - Dispatcher and working guide (alwaysApply: true)
- `master_rule.mdc` - Comprehensive governance for project management
- `system-context.mdc` - High-level system overview (alwaysApply: true)

**When Applied**: Always active for project management tasks

### ClinicPro Technical Rules
**Scope**: Code development, debugging, technical workflows

**Files**:
- `debugging-strategy.mdc` - Disciplined error handling approach

**When Applied**: Always active for technical/code tasks

## Conflict Resolution

### alwaysApply Rules
Two NexWave rules have `alwaysApply: true`:
- `current-task.mdc` (NexWave - dispatcher)
- `system-context.mdc` (NexWave - system overview)

**Resolution**: 
- Both NexWave rules apply to project management workflow
- No conflicts with ClinicPro technical rules

### Scope Clarity
- **Project Management Tasks**: Follow NexWave rules (dispatcher, master rule, AI character)
- **Technical/Code Tasks**: Follow ClinicPro rules (debugging-strategy)
- **Hybrid Tasks**: Both rule sets apply, but NexWave rules handle project context, ClinicPro rules handle debugging approach

## Recommended Workflow

1. **For Project Management Tasks**:
   - Read NexWave rules first (dispatcher → master rule → AI character)
   - Update project documentation per NexWave master rule

2. **For Technical/Code Tasks**:
   - Read ClinicPro technical rules (debugging-strategy)
   - Reference NexWave rules only if project context needed
   - Focus on ClinicPro debugging approach for error handling

3. **For Hybrid Tasks**:
   - Read NexWave dispatcher to understand project context
   - Apply ClinicPro rules for code implementation
   - Update project docs per NexWave master rule

## Integration Points

- **Project Context**: NexWave rules provide project structure (`/project-management/`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`)
- **Code Quality**: ClinicPro rules provide debugging approach (error handling strategy)
- **Documentation**: Nexus between both - code changes documented in project `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` per NexWave rules

## TODO: Rules Review

**Status**: Pending review to resolve conflicts and optimize integration

**Tasks**:
- [x] Removed `output_structure.mdc` and `token-optimisation.mdc` (deleted)
- [ ] Review remaining ClinicPro rules integration
- [ ] Clarify when each rule set applies (project vs technical)
- [ ] Document best practices for hybrid tasks
