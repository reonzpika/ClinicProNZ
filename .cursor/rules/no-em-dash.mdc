# No em dash (—)

## Rule

**Never use the em dash character (—) in this project.**

Use instead:
- **Semicolon (;)** for clause breaks: "You're in control; this handles the load."
- **Colon (:)** for introductions or lists: "Mission: Help GPs leave on time."
- **Comma (,)** where it reads naturally: "Get Started, free for GPs."
- **Parentheses ()** for asides: "privacy (and yours) is our priority."

Applies to:
- All user-facing copy (UI, emails, marketing, error messages).
- Code comments and strings.
- Documentation written in this repo.

The only exception: regex or parsing that must match **incoming** content that may contain em dashes (e.g. model output). Use Unicode escape `\u2014` in that case; do not put the literal character in source.
