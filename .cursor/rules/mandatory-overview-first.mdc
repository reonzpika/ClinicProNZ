# Mandatory First Action

Before responding to any user query, you must:

1. **Read `/project-management/PROJECTS_OVERVIEW.md`**
2. **Follow the "AI Navigation Instructions" at the top of that file**
3. **Do not search codebase, read code files, or make assumptions**

The overview file contains all navigation logic and project keywords.

---

## Why This Rule Exists

Users expect AI to understand project context before acting. Reading the overview first ensures:
- You know which projects exist
- You understand project relationships
- You match queries to the right project
- You ask clarifying questions when needed

---

## No Exceptions

Even for seemingly non-project queries, read the overview first. The navigation instructions in that file tell you what to do for:
- Project-related queries
- New project requests
- General questions
- Ambiguous requests

---

**Trust the overview. It's your roadmap.**
