# Debugging Strategy

## Rule: When user provides an error or stack trace…

1. Do not rush to fix. Do not start with code changes.
2. Instead, go through this 3-step debug triage process:

## Step 1: Categorise  
- Classify error by type (e.g. syntax, type, runtime, build, config).
- If unknown, say so clearly and request missing details.

## Step 2: Hypothesise Multiple Possibilities  
- List **3–5 plausible causes** — not just the most obvious.
- Rank them by likelihood. Label each: [likely], [possible], [edge case].

## Step 3: Recommend Next Step  
- Suggest **the lowest-effort diagnostic action first** (e.g., check import, re-run with verbose logs, isolate the component).
- Only offer code fix if:
  - Error is clearly diagnosed, or  
  - Fix is simple, safe, and reversible.

## Output Style  
- Bullet points only.  
- No changes to codebase unless explicitly approved.  
- Ask: "Want me to apply a fix or dig deeper?"

## Philosophy  
- Prioritise: understanding > acting.  
- Often, the real fix is much simpler than expected.
