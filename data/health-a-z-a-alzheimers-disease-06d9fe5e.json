Dementia is a general word used to describe symptoms of declining brain function. Symptoms of dementia include problems with memory, thinking, behaviour and being able to do daily tasks. Dementia is not a normal part of ageing.\nIn Alzheimer’s disease there are physical changes in your cerebral cortex, which is the greyish-pink outer layer of your brain. Abnormal proteins (beta amyloid plaques and tau tangles) build up in your brain. Your brain cells make less of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which sends messages around your brain. The abnormal proteins lead to the death of brain cells, and your brain shrinks. Over about 10 years your brain works less and less well and symptoms start to show up.\nAlzheimer's is a progressive disease, which means that gradually over time, more parts of your brain are damaged. As this happens, the symptoms get more severe.\nIt affects about 70,000 people in Aotearoa New Zealand, that’s about 1.4% of the population. It’s getting more common as we live longer.\nDementia affects about 1 in 20 people over the age of 65 and 1 in 5 over the age of 80. About two-thirds of these will have dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. It’s very common to have both Alzheimer’s disease and the second most common type, vascular dementia. This is called mixed dementia.\n####  What causes Alzheimer’s disease? (+ VIDEO) \nWe don’t know exactly what causes Alzheimer’s disease. It's probably a combination of things, including age, genes and environmental factors. \n**Age:** This is the greatest risk factor for dementia. However, younger people can also get early-onset dementia, about half of early onset dementia is caused by Alzheimer's disease. \n**Genetic inheritance:** A number of genes have been found that increase the risk of developing the condition. The chance of developing Alzheimer's disease is greater if you have a parent or brother or sister with it. However, very few families have a direct inheritance of the condition from one generation to the next, and where they do, it usually appears early in life.\n**Environmental factors:** People with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease include those who:\n  * are smokers\n  * have [high blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high)\n  * have [diabetes](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/diabetes-overview)\n  * have [high cholesterol levels](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high)\n  * have had a serious [head injury](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/head-injury)\n  * have Caucasian ethnicity (this is different to vascular dementia, which is more common if you have Māori or Pacific ancestry)\n  * have [Down syndrome](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/down-syndrome) or [Parkinson’s disease.](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/parkinsons)\n\n\nRead more about risk factors for[dementia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia).\n####    \nVideo: The genetics of Alzheimer's\n(About Alzheimer's, US, 2010)\n####  What are the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease? \nWhile there are some common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, everyone is unique. No two people with Alzheimer's have exactly the same symptoms.\nProblems with remembering things that have happened recently are usually the first thing you or the people around you will notice. You’ll usually remember things that happened in the past very well until much later. In the beginning you may:\n  * have problems finding the right words\n  * forget the names of people and places\n  * forget appointments.\n\n\nAs time goes by you may:\n  * not be able to concentrate or pay attention\n  * get lost, especially in new places\n  * lose track of time\n  * have trouble understanding what is said to you, or what is written down\n  * have increasing difficulty solving problems and managing complex or new tasks\n  * show less initiative or withdraw from your usual activities\n  * experience emotional and personality changes, such as frustration, anxiety or sadness\n  * become more irritable, suspicious or less emotionally responsive\n  * get confused.\n\n\n####  How is Alzheimer’s disease diagnosed? \nIf you're concerned you or someone close to you may have symptoms of Alzheimer's disease or dementia, it's a good idea to see your healthcare provider. An early diagnosis will:\n  * help you plan for the future\n  * allow you to benefit from the treatments available\n  * help you and your whānau find advice and support.\n\n\nYour healthcare provider will ask you and the people closest to you about changes you’ve noticed. They will do a cognitive screening test (eg the [mini-ACE](https://healthify.nz/tools/m/mini-ace)) to check how well your memory and other brain functions are working.\nYour healthcare provider will examine you and will likely order blood tests to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms such as depression, delirium, thyroid problems, side effects of medicines, vitamin deficiencies or a brain tumour. \nYou may need a [CT scan](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/ct-scan) of your head. If the diagnosis is not clear your healthcare provider may refer you to Older Persons Health services. \n####  What is the treatment for Alzheimer’s disease? (+ APPS) \nThere is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, there are treatments to help slow it down.\n####    \nLifestyle changes\nLifestyle factors can affect dementia risk and by changing those, you can make the most of your brain. Looking after your brain means:\n  * getting regular exercise\n  * avoiding or reducing alcohol and other substance use\n  * eating a healthy diet\n  * getting enough sleep\n  * getting a hearing aid if you have hearing loss\n  * getting eyesight problems fixed if possible, or having up to date glasses\n  * keeping up your social activities.\n\n\nIt may also be useful to do brain exercises such as puzzles or use [phone apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/d/dementia-apps) and practice memory strategies such as lists and reminder notes.\n####    \nCognitive stimulation therapy\nIn some parts of Aotearoa New Zealand, there is the option of cognitive stimulation therapy (CST). This is a structured group treatment developed for people with mild to moderate dementia. There are 14 sessions with a range of activities and discussions aimed at improving cognitive and social functioning. Some rest homes and private hospitals also run similar programmes to CST.\n####    \nHeart risk factors\nManagement of heart risk factors may benefit all types of dementia. Generally, what's good for your heart is good for your brain. Read about[heart risk assessment](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-risk-assessment \"Heart risk assessment\").\n####    \nMedicines\nYour healthcare provider will discuss stopping or changing any medicines that can cause or worsen confusion.\nThere are medicines that can help some people with the symptoms of forgetfulness and confusion.\n**Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors**\nThese work by increasing the levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) in the brain that is involved in memory and judgment. They can help with some of the symptoms or hold back progression of the disease (on average, by 6 to 12 months) if you have mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors include [donepezil](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/donepezil), [rivastigmine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/r/rivastigmine) and [galantamine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/g/galantamine).\n**NMDA receptor antagonists**\nAn NMDA receptor antagonist called [memantine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/memantine) is also available in Aotearoa New Zealand for moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. This prevents too much calcium moving into brain cells. Too much calcium in your brain cells damages them and stops them from getting messages from other brain cells.\nRead more about [medicines for dementia](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/dementia-medications).\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [dementia apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/d/dementia-apps). \n####  Planning for the future with Alzheimer's disease \nThere are some things you can do to plan ahead if you have Alzheimer's disease. These things will help you and your whānau prepare for the future.\n#### Care planning meeting\nPlan ahead so that you have more say in your future. Arrange a meeting (or get someone else to do it) with all the people involved in your care. This may include your carer, family/whānau members, or your practice nurse or GP.\nAgree on a care plan to support you to stay as well as possible for as long as possible. This might include:\n  * having a driving assessment\n  * arranging enduring power of attorney\n  * writing or updating your will\n  * developing an advance care plan\n  * accessing services to help you stay independent for as long as possible\n  * learning about your condition.\n\n\nRead more about all of these [things you can do to care for yourself with dementia or Alzheimer's](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia#self-care-for-dementia). \n####  VIDEO: Personal stories \nThese personal stories reveal the challenges that come with Alzheimer's disease, not just for you but for your family too.\n####    \nVideo: Living well with dementia – Rita's story\n  \n(Alzheimers NZ, 2018)\n####    \nVideo: Together apart\nFilmmaker, Suzi Jowsey, bravely follows her own family’s tough journey of caring for their mum who has Alzheimer’s.  \n  \n\n####    \nVideo: A message for patients and their families\nThis video talks about getting support and things you should consider if you or a family member are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  \n  \n\n####  What's the outlook for Alzheimer's disease? \nMany people live satisfying lives with Alzheimer’s disease for years. Some people live for up to 20 years after diagnosis, but the usual time is 7 to 10 years.\nBecause it’s a progressive condition it gets worse over time. Your memory for people and events in your life will likely be lost. You may wander and get lost. As time goes by many people then get less able to walk and move around. As your brain function gets worse you'll become less able to care for yourself. Alzheimer’s Disease can cause problems with swallowing and eating. You may no longer be able to control going to the toilet. You are likely to need extra care in your home or you may need to move into residential care.\n####  Alzheimer's support \n  * [Alzheimers NZ(external link)](http://www.alzheimers.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") Phone support 0800 004 001 \n  * Find your [local Alzheimer's NZ branch(external link)](http://www.alzheimers.org.nz/contact-us \"Open external link\")\n  * [Dementia NZ(external link)](https://dementia.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n  * [Carers NZ(external link)](http://www.carers.net.nz/home \"Open external link\") 0800 777 797\n  * [More dementia support groups](https://healthify.nz/support/d/dementia-support \"Open external link\")\n  * [Eldernet(external link)](https://www.eldernet.co.nz/Home \"Open external link\")\n  * [Seniorline(external link)](http://seniorline.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Dementia | Mate wareware](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia \"Dementia | Mate korongenge\")  \n[Driving and dementia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-driving \"Driving and dementia\")  \n[Reducing your risk of dementia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-reducing-your-risk \"Reducing your risk of dementia\")  \n[Ageing – what is normal and when to seek medical advice](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ageing-common-health-problems \"Ageing – what is normal and when to seek medical advice\")  \n[Advance care planning](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/advance-care-planning \"Advance care planning\")  \n[Enduring power of attorney](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/e/enduring-power-of-attorney \"Enduring power of attorney\")  \n[Dementia for healthcare providers](https://healthify.nz/healthcare-providers/d/dementia-hcps)  \n[Mini-ACE](https://healthify.nz/tools/m/mini-ace \"Mini-ACE\")  \n[Dementia topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-topics)  \n[Personal medical alarms and ID](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/personal-medical-alarms-and-ids)\n####  More information \n**Note:** Some resources below are from overseas so some details may be different.

They can help with some of the symptoms or hold back progression of the disease (on average, by 6 to 12 months) if you have mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors include [donepezil](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/donepezil), [rivastigmine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/r/rivastigmine) and [galantamine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/g/galantamine).\n**NMDA receptor antagonists**\nAn NMDA receptor antagonist called [memantine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/memantine) is also available in Aotearoa New Zealand for moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. This prevents too much calcium moving into brain cells. Too much calcium in your brain cells damages them and stops them from getting messages from other brain cells.\nRead more about [medicines for dementia](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/dementia-medications).\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [dementia apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/d/dementia-apps). \n####  Planning for the future with Alzheimer's disease \nThere are some things you can do to plan ahead if you have Alzheimer's disease. These things will help you and your whānau prepare for the future.\n#### Care planning meeting\nPlan ahead so that you have more say in your future. Arrange a meeting (or get someone else to do it) with all the people involved in your care. This may include your carer, family/whānau members, or your practice nurse or GP.\nAgree on a care plan to support you to stay as well as possible for as long as possible. This might include:\n  * having a driving assessment\n  * arranging enduring power of attorney\n  * writing or updating your will\n  * developing an advance care plan\n  * accessing services to help you stay independent for as long as possible\n  * learning about your condition.\n\n\nRead more about all of these [things you can do to care for yourself with dementia or Alzheimer's](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia#self-care-for-dementia). \n####  VIDEO: Personal stories \nThese personal stories reveal the challenges that come with Alzheimer's disease, not just for you but for your family too.\n####    \nVideo: Living well with dementia – Rita's story\n  \n(Alzheimers NZ, 2018)\n####    \nVideo: Together apart\nFilmmaker, Suzi Jowsey, bravely follows her own family’s tough journey of caring for their mum who has Alzheimer’s.  \n  \n\n####    \nVideo: A message for patients and their families\nThis video talks about getting support and things you should consider if you or a family member are diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  \n  \n\n####  What's the outlook for Alzheimer's disease? \nMany people live satisfying lives with Alzheimer’s disease for years. Some people live for up to 20 years after diagnosis, but the usual time is 7 to 10 years.\nBecause it’s a progressive condition it gets worse over time. Your memory for people and events in your life will likely be lost. You may wander and get lost. As time goes by many people then get less able to walk and move around. As your brain function gets worse you'll become less able to care for yourself. Alzheimer’s Disease can cause problems with swallowing and eating. You may no longer be able to control going to the toilet. You are likely to need extra care in your home or you may need to move into residential care.\n####  Alzheimer's support \n  * [Alzheimers NZ(external link)](http://www.alzheimers.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") Phone support 0800 004 001 \n  * Find your [local Alzheimer's NZ branch(external link)](http://www.alzheimers.org.nz/contact-us \"Open external link\")\n  * [Dementia NZ(external link)](https://dementia.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n  * [Carers NZ(external link)](http://www.carers.net.nz/home \"Open external link\") 0800 777 797\n  * [More dementia support groups](https://healthify.nz/support/d/dementia-support \"Open external link\")\n  * [Eldernet(external link)](https://www.eldernet.co.nz/Home \"Open external link\")\n  * [Seniorline(external link)](http://seniorline.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Dementia | Mate wareware](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia \"Dementia | Mate korongenge\")  \n[Driving and dementia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-driving \"Driving and dementia\")  \n[Reducing your risk of dementia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-reducing-your-risk \"Reducing your risk of dementia\")  \n[Ageing – what is normal and when to seek medical advice](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ageing-common-health-problems \"Ageing – what is normal and when to seek medical advice\")  \n[Advance care planning](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/advance-care-planning \"Advance care planning\")  \n[Enduring power of attorney](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/e/enduring-power-of-attorney \"Enduring power of attorney\")  \n[Dementia for healthcare providers](https://healthify.nz/healthcare-providers/d/dementia-hcps)  \n[Mini-ACE](https://healthify.nz/tools/m/mini-ace \"Mini-ACE\")  \n[Dementia topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia-topics)  \n[Personal medical alarms and ID](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/personal-medical-alarms-and-ids)\n####  More information \n**Note:** Some resources below are from overseas so some details may be different.
