This can make it difficult to know if you are having an aortic dissection. \nCommon symptoms of aortic dissection include:\n  * [chest pain](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chest-pain \"Chest pain\")\n  * chest pain that feels like tearing, ripping or shearing\n  * chest pain that can spread to your neck or back\n  * a fast onset of fever-like symptoms and sweating\n  * severe tummy pain \n  * shortness of breath\n  * fainting or dizziness\n  * loss of consciousness\n  * loss of vision or blurry vision\n  * weakness of your arms or legs. \n\n\n####  What are the causes of aortic dissection? \nThe aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body. It comes directly from your heart to supply blood to the rest of your body.  \n  \nAortic dissection happens when the inner layer of the wall of your aorta tears, causing blood to flow between the inner and middle layer of your aorta, separating the layers. This causes reduced blood and oxygen supply to the rest of your body such as your brain, kidneys and heart. In more serious cases, your aorta can burst and cause death. \nConditions that can weaken the wall of the aorta can increase your risk of getting aortic dissection. These include:\n  * [high blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high)\n  * aortic aneurysm (the wall of the aorta bulges like a balloon)\n  * [coronary artery disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/coronary-artery-disease \"Coronary artery disease\")[atherosclerosis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/atherosclerosis \"Atherosclerosis\")\n  * Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome \n  * heart valve disease involving the aortic valve\n  * regular cocaine or amphetamine use \n  * extremely strenuous exercise such as weightlifting\n  * severe traumatic injury to the chest.\n\n\nOther general risk factors include:\n  * [smoking](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-topics \"Smoking\")\n  * a family history of aortic dissection\n  * being male (men are 2 times more likely to get aortic dissection than women) \n  * being over 60 years of age\n  * [pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy \"Pregnancy\").\n\n\n####  What are the complications of aortic dissection? \nComplications of an aortic dissection include:\n  * [stroke](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/stroke \"Stroke\")\n  * damage to an organ, such as[kidney failure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/k/kidney-acute-kidney-injury \"Kidney – acute kidney injury\")\n  * aortic valve damage\n  * cardiac tamponade (accumulation of blood in the lining around your heart and putting pressure on your heart)\n  * sudden death.\n\n\n####  How is aortic dissection diagnosed? \nYour doctor will do several tests to find out whether you have had an aortic dissection or rule out other similar conditions such as a heart attack.  \n  \nThese tests may include:\n  * blood tests\n  * [ECG](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/electrocardiograph-ecg)\n  * [echocardiogram](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/echocardiogram \"Echocardiogram\")\n  * [chest X-ray](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/x/x-ray#chest-x-ray)\n  * [CT scan](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/ct-scan \"CT scan\")\n  * [MRI scan](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/m/mri-scan \"MRI Scan\")\n\n\n####  How is aortic dissection treated? \nIf you have an aortic dissection, treatment will be needed immediately to save your life. Surgery is usually needed to repair the damaged blood vessel. You may also be given a blood pressure-lowering medicine such as[beta blockers](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/beta-blockers \"Beta blockers\")  \n  \nAfter the surgery, you need to stay in hospital for a while until you recover enough to go home. You may also need to attend follow-up checks after your treatment to monitor your aorta and make sure you are recovering well.\n####  What is the outlook for someone with aortic dissection? \nAortic dissection is life threatening and often fatal if the aorta ruptures or if the condition is left undiagnosed and untreated. However, early diagnosis and treatment increases survival rates.  \n  \nAfter your initial treatment, you may be advised that there are things you can no longer do in order to reduce the risk of long-term complications. For example, you may need to avoid strenuous physical activity and activities that involve heavy lifting because these can increase blood pressure and therefore put stress on the aortic wall.  \n  \nNormal daily activities such as cooking, bathing, driving, climbing stairs and mild aerobic exercise are usually fine, but contact sports are not recommended. You may also need to change your job, as sedentary jobs are often more appropriate for people who have had an aortic dissection.  \n  \nThere are sometimes complications that require further treatment.   \n  \nHaving such a major medical event occur out of the blue is shocking and you need time and support to come to terms with it happening. There can also be physical and emotional challenges on the road to recovery. To help you recover, you may also need talking therapy and connection with other people who have been through the experience. \n####  How can I care for myself with aortic dissection? \nThere are a few things you can do to help manage your condition.  \n  \nThese include taking the following steps:\n  * Controlling and managing your[blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure \"Blood pressure\") – this can be achieved by a low-salt diet and blood pressure medicines. See your GP if you are unsure whether your blood pressure is well controlled. \n  * [Quitting smoking](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-topics \"Smoking\")\n  * Having a healthy balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight.\n  * Attending your cardiology follow-up appointments or[cardiac rehabilitation](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/h/heart-disease-cardiac-rehabilitation)\n\n\n####  How can I prevent aortic dissection? \nYou can reduce your risk of getting an aortic dissection by doing these things:\n  * Controlling and managing your[blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure \"Blood pressure\") – this can be achieved by a low-salt diet and blood pressure medicines.

Heart attacks are far more common than aortic dissection, but if a heart attack or other diagnosis is not clearly and quickly established, then aortic dissection should be quickly considered and ruled out. This is especially important if a patient has a family history of thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection or features of a genetic syndrome that predisposes the patient to an aortic aneurysm or dissection.\n#### Management\nBecause people with this condition end up in hospital out of the blue, they are often completely bemused and bewildered during the primary treatment. They will need a lot of factual information to help them understand their situation, as well as emotional support to help them recover from the shock and adjust to their changed circumstances.\n#### Clinical resources\n[Ritter rules(external link)](https://www.johnritterfoundation.org/ritter-rules \"Open external link\") John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health, US  \n[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/heart-conditions/aortic-dissection \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ  \n[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://patient.info/doctor/aortic-dissection \"Open external link\")  \nJuang D, Braverman AC, Eagle K.[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.799908#:~:text=Lifestyle%20modifications%20are%20necessary%20to,stress%20on%20the%20aortic%20wall. \"Open external link\") Circulation. 2008;118:e507–e510.\n#### Continuing professional development\n[Recognition of vascular emergencies in primary care webinar(external link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FJBttNkm14 \"Open external link\") – Mr Venu Bhamidi, Goodfellow Unit Webinar, NZ, 2016\n## Need help now?\n[![Healthline logo in supporters block](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Healthline-Supporters-Block__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthy.org.nz/ \"Contact Healthline \")\n[![Need to talk logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Need-to-talk-1737-logo-800x400__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://1737.org.nz/ \"Contact 1737\")\n[![Healthpoint logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Health-Point-logo__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/ \"Healthpoint website\")\nEmail\nCredits: Healthify editorial team.

Heart attacks are far more common than aortic dissection, but if a heart attack or other diagnosis is not clearly and quickly established, then aortic dissection should be quickly considered and ruled out. This is especially important if a patient has a family history of thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection or features of a genetic syndrome that predisposes the patient to an aortic aneurysm or dissection.\n#### Management\nBecause people with this condition end up in hospital out of the blue, they are often completely bemused and bewildered during the primary treatment. They will need a lot of factual information to help them understand their situation, as well as emotional support to help them recover from the shock and adjust to their changed circumstances.\n#### Clinical resources\n[Ritter rules(external link)](https://www.johnritterfoundation.org/ritter-rules \"Open external link\") John Ritter Foundation for Aortic Health, US  \n[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/heart-conditions/aortic-dissection \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ  \n[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://patient.info/doctor/aortic-dissection \"Open external link\")  \nJuang D, Braverman AC, Eagle K.[Aortic dissection(external link)](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.108.799908#:~:text=Lifestyle%20modifications%20are%20necessary%20to,stress%20on%20the%20aortic%20wall. \"Open external link\") Circulation. 2008;118:e507–e510.\n#### Continuing professional development\n[Recognition of vascular emergencies in primary care webinar(external link)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FJBttNkm14 \"Open external link\") – Mr Venu Bhamidi, Goodfellow Unit Webinar, NZ, 2016\n## Need help now?\n[![Healthline logo in supporters block](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Healthline-Supporters-Block__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthy.org.nz/ \"Contact Healthline \")\n[![Need to talk logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Need-to-talk-1737-logo-800x400__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://1737.org.nz/ \"Contact 1737\")\n[![Healthpoint logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Health-Point-logo__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/ \"Healthpoint website\")\nEmail\nCredits: Healthify editorial team.
