During pregnancy, asthma control improves for about a third of women, gets worse for a third and stays the same for about a third. \nAsthma symptoms can get worse at any stage of pregnancy, but it's most likely to happen between 17 and 36 weeks – mainly in the 6th month of pregnancy.\nAsthma can also begin again during pregnancy even if you haven’t experienced asthma symptoms since you were a child.\n####  How does asthma affect pregnancy? \nIf your asthma is well controlled during pregnancy, you’ll generally have a normal pregnancy with little or no increased risk of harm to you or your developing baby.\nIf your asthma isn’t controlled during pregnancy, it can cause possible harm to you and your baby. If you're having trouble breathing, your baby might not get enough oxygen.\n####    \nRisks to your health\n  * High blood pressure and pre-eclampsia – a condition associated with high blood pressure that can affect the placenta, kidneys, liver and brain.\n  * Vaginal bleeding.\n  * Complicated labour.\n\n\n####    \nRisks to your baby's health\n  * Slow growth of your pēpi and low birth weight (the baby is small when born).\n  * Preterm birth (early birth before 37th week of pregnancy).\n  * Death of the baby immediately before or after birth.\n\n\n####  Warning signs to look out for \nSigns that your asthma may be getting worse include:\n  * a cough that is worse at night, early morning, or when you exercise\n  * wheezing\n  * breathlessness \n  * tightness in your chest\n  * using more of your reliever inhaler than usual (if you’re needing to use your reliever inhaler 3 or more times per week you may be at risk of an asthma attack).  \n\n\n\nIf you have these symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider or asthma specialist, who will advise you on the best treatment. \n####    \nSigns of a severe asthma attack include:\n  * severe difficulty with breathing, walking or talking\n  * your lips or skin turning blue\n  * exhaustion and tiredness due to the effort of breathing\n  * wheezing stopping suddenly.  \n\n\n\n**If you experience any of these signs of a severe asthma attack, dial 111 and ask for an ambulance.**\n####  Is it safe to take asthma medication during pregnancy? \nAny medicine you take during pregnancy can affect your baby, but inhaled asthma medicines won’t harm your baby. Your baby will do best if you are breathing well, so it’s important that your asthma is well-controlled.\nMedical experts advise that it’s far safer to manage your asthma with medicine than it is to leave asthma untreated or poorly controlled during pregnancy. So, it’s important to keep taking your medicine as normal unless your healthcare provider tells you to stop.\nAsthma treatment during pregnancy is the same for non-pregnant people.

Most women don’t get severe asthma symptoms during labour and delivery. During labour and delivery you have the same choice of pain medication as any woman. \nYou may be advised to have continuous monitoring of your baby during labour and delivery.\nIt’s safe to continue your asthma medicines while you’re breastfeeding. Inhaled asthma medicines are not found in breast milk. Breastfeeding has lots of benefits for you and your baby and it may reduce the chances of your child developing asthma.\n####  What self-care can I do if I have asthma and I'm pregnant? (+ APPS) \nThere are many things you can do to help reduce the severity of your asthma symptoms and how often you get them.\n####   \nHave an asthma management action plan\nEveryone with asthma should have an [asthma management action plan(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/resources/topic/asthma-action-plans \"Open external link\"). This is a written plan that you develop with your healthcare provider to help control your asthma.\nYour action plan describes the medicines you need to take and when to take them. It also explains how to adjust your treatment to meet your needs, such as if your asthma is getting worse, or during asthma attacks.\nAlso, make sure that asthma is included in your [birth plan](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-birth-plans) so that everyone supporting you during your pregnancy and labour knows you have asthma and what to do if you have symptoms.\n####    \nExercise regularly\nYou can continue to exercise normally during your pregnancy. If you find that exercise makes your asthma worse, try using your reliever or combination inhaler before exercise.\nTalk to your healthcare provider about how you should manage your symptoms.\n####    \nAvoid smoking\nDon't smoke or vape during your pregnancy and avoid second hand smoke. This can make your asthma worse.\nSmoking during pregnancy increases the chance of [sudden unexplained death of an infant (SUDI)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/sudi \"SUDI\") and of [chest infections](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chest-infections \"Chest infections\"), [asthma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-children \"Asthma – children\") and [middle-ear disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/ear-infection-middle-ear \"Ear infection \\(middle ear\\)\") in babies.\nRead more about [smoking and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-and-pregnancy), and [how to quit.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-why-quit)\n####    \nAvoid allergic triggers\nAs much as possible try to avoid or control the things that make your asthma worse (called triggers), such as animal fur, pollen, mould and dust.\n####    \nControl conditions affecting your nose\nConditions such as [sinusitis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/sinusitis-acute \"Sinusitis – acute\") or [hay fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever\") can make asthma worse. The common symptoms are sneezing, a blocked or runny nose, an itchy nose, mouth or inner ear, and [headaches](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/headache \"Headache\").\nTalk to your healthcare provider about how to best manage these symptoms if they bother you. \n####    \nControl gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms\n[GORD](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/g/gastro-oesophageal-reflux \"Gastro-oesophageal reflux\") causes acid reflux and heartburn, which can make asthma symptoms worse. If you develop GORD, talk to your healthcare provider about how to best manage your symptoms.   \n  \nSome suggestions to help reduce GORD symptoms include to:\n  * raise the head of your bed with extra pillows\n  * eat smaller meals\n  * wait at least 3 hours after eating before lying down\n  * avoid foods that seem to cause heartburn.\n\n\n####    \nGet the flu, pertussis and COVID-19 vaccine\nHaving the [flu (influenza)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/influenza) can make your asthma worse. The flu vaccine gives you extra protection against the flu. It's safe to be vaccinated while hāpu and is recommended for all pregnant people. Get the flu vaccine as soon as it is available, whether you're in your first, second or third trimester at the time.\nIf you catch COVID-19 when you’re pregnant, you’re more likely to become very unwell, so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated or get your booster when you become eligible. You can get a COVID-19 vaccine at any stage of your pregnancy.\nPertussis vaccine protects against the bacterial infection [whooping cough](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/w/whooping-cough) (also called pertussis) that causes uncontrollable coughing. Complications can be serious, including pneumonia and seizures. You should have the pertussis vaccine preferably within the second trimester of pregnancy, from 16 weeks, but at least 2 weeks before the birth of your baby. When you receive the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy, your baby is protected from severe whooping cough for the first few weeks after birth, but they should then be vaccinated themselves at the age of 6 weeks.\nRead more about [vaccinations and pregnancy.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation)\n####   \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps), [breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps), and [pregnancy apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pregnancy-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Asthma in adults](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults \"Asthma in adults\")  \n[Pregnancy topics](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy \"Pregnancy topics\")  \n[Vaccinations and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation \"Vaccinations and pregnancy\")  \n[Smoking and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-and-pregnancy)\n####  More information \n[Asthma and pregnancy(external link)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/asthma/ \"Open external link\") NHS, UK  \n[Asthma in pregnancy toolkit(external link)](https://www.sign.ac.uk/media/1140/pat158_pregnancy.pdf \"Open external link\") Centre of Excellence in Treatable Traits, Australia\n####    \nResources\n[Asthma self management plan(external link)](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets.asthmafoundation.org.nz/documents/Asthma-Self-Management-Plan-Resource.pdf \"Open external link\") The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2013  \n[GINA patient guide for asthma – you can control your asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/GINA-Patient-Guide-Feb-2022.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2021   \n[Asthma checklist(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Asthma-Checklist.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Your unborn child, asthma, and allergies(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Your-Unborn-Child-Asthma-Allergies-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010  \n[Women and asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Women-Asthma-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010\n####    \nReferences\n  1.

This can make your asthma worse.\nSmoking during pregnancy increases the chance of [sudden unexplained death of an infant (SUDI)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/sudi \"SUDI\") and of [chest infections](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chest-infections \"Chest infections\"), [asthma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-children \"Asthma – children\") and [middle-ear disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/ear-infection-middle-ear \"Ear infection \\(middle ear\\)\") in babies.\nRead more about [smoking and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-and-pregnancy), and [how to quit.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-why-quit)\n####    \nAvoid allergic triggers\nAs much as possible try to avoid or control the things that make your asthma worse (called triggers), such as animal fur, pollen, mould and dust.\n####    \nControl conditions affecting your nose\nConditions such as [sinusitis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/sinusitis-acute \"Sinusitis – acute\") or [hay fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever\") can make asthma worse. The common symptoms are sneezing, a blocked or runny nose, an itchy nose, mouth or inner ear, and [headaches](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/headache \"Headache\").\nTalk to your healthcare provider about how to best manage these symptoms if they bother you. \n####    \nControl gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) symptoms\n[GORD](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/g/gastro-oesophageal-reflux \"Gastro-oesophageal reflux\") causes acid reflux and heartburn, which can make asthma symptoms worse. If you develop GORD, talk to your healthcare provider about how to best manage your symptoms.   \n  \nSome suggestions to help reduce GORD symptoms include to:\n  * raise the head of your bed with extra pillows\n  * eat smaller meals\n  * wait at least 3 hours after eating before lying down\n  * avoid foods that seem to cause heartburn.\n\n\n####    \nGet the flu, pertussis and COVID-19 vaccine\nHaving the [flu (influenza)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/influenza) can make your asthma worse. The flu vaccine gives you extra protection against the flu. It's safe to be vaccinated while hāpu and is recommended for all pregnant people. Get the flu vaccine as soon as it is available, whether you're in your first, second or third trimester at the time.\nIf you catch COVID-19 when you’re pregnant, you’re more likely to become very unwell, so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated or get your booster when you become eligible. You can get a COVID-19 vaccine at any stage of your pregnancy.\nPertussis vaccine protects against the bacterial infection [whooping cough](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/w/whooping-cough) (also called pertussis) that causes uncontrollable coughing. Complications can be serious, including pneumonia and seizures. You should have the pertussis vaccine preferably within the second trimester of pregnancy, from 16 weeks, but at least 2 weeks before the birth of your baby. When you receive the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy, your baby is protected from severe whooping cough for the first few weeks after birth, but they should then be vaccinated themselves at the age of 6 weeks.\nRead more about [vaccinations and pregnancy.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation)\n####   \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps), [breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps), and [pregnancy apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pregnancy-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Asthma in adults](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults \"Asthma in adults\")  \n[Pregnancy topics](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy \"Pregnancy topics\")  \n[Vaccinations and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation \"Vaccinations and pregnancy\")  \n[Smoking and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-and-pregnancy)\n####  More information \n[Asthma and pregnancy(external link)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/asthma/ \"Open external link\") NHS, UK  \n[Asthma in pregnancy toolkit(external link)](https://www.sign.ac.uk/media/1140/pat158_pregnancy.pdf \"Open external link\") Centre of Excellence in Treatable Traits, Australia\n####    \nResources\n[Asthma self management plan(external link)](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets.asthmafoundation.org.nz/documents/Asthma-Self-Management-Plan-Resource.pdf \"Open external link\") The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2013  \n[GINA patient guide for asthma – you can control your asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/GINA-Patient-Guide-Feb-2022.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2021   \n[Asthma checklist(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Asthma-Checklist.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Your unborn child, asthma, and allergies(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Your-Unborn-Child-Asthma-Allergies-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010  \n[Women and asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Women-Asthma-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
