You find it difficult to breathe, your chest can feel tight, and you might wheeze or cough. \n![Diagram of labelled respiratory system and normal and asthmatic airways](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Respiratory/Asthma-diagram-Depositphotos-800x800__ResizedImageWzcwMCw3MDBd.png)\n_Image credit: Depositphotos_\n**Note:** The information on this page is for adults.

Someone having an asthma attack may not be able to follow asthma first aid themselves – they are relying on you to help. \n#### A = Assess\nAssess whether the person's asthma attack is mild, moderate or severe.\nIf the person has **severe asthma** or is frightened, call an ambulance on 111.\n#### S = Sit\nSit the person upright and stay with them. Reassure them calmly.\n#### T = Treat (with a reliever inhaler)\nIt's important to carry your reliever inhaler with you at all times. If you're helping someone else you may need to help them find one.\n  * **Symbicort or DuoResp Spiromax:** Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 12 puffs daily. These inhalers quickly reduce inflammation of your airways and help you to breathe more easily.\n  * **Ventolin or SalAir:** Always use a spacer with these inhalers. Inhale 1 puff through the spacer and take 6 breaths per puff. Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 6 puffs. For severe symptoms, use 6 puffs through the spacer, every 6 minutes until help arrives. Make sure to take 6 slow breaths for each puff.\n  * **Bricanyl** : Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 6 puffs. \n\n\n####    \nH = Help\nIf the person is not improving, call an ambulance immediately on 111. Continue to use the reliever inhaler every few minutes until help arrives.\n#### M = Monitor\n  * If the person is improving, keep monitoring them for signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms. If necessary, repeat doses of the reliever inhaler.\n  * If the person is not improving, continue to use the reliever inhaler every few minutes until help arrives. \n\n\n####    \nA = All OK!\nWhen the person is free of wheeze, cough or breathlessness, they can return to quiet activity.\nMake sure a preventer inhaler is part of your asthma management plan. This is important to reduce the chance of this type of attack happening. This may mean a separate preventer inhaler is needed, or a combined reliever and preventer inhaler if you don't have this already.\nMake sure an asthma action plan is written up to guide you through asthma attacks in the future. Regular peak flow monitoring may be useful to reduce the chance of further asthma attacks.
