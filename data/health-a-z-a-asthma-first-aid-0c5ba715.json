You find it difficult to breathe, your chest can feel tight, and you might wheeze or cough. \n![Diagram of labelled respiratory system and normal and asthmatic airways](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Respiratory/Asthma-diagram-Depositphotos-800x800__ResizedImageWzcwMCw3MDBd.png)\n_Image credit: Depositphotos_\n**Note:** The information on this page is for adults. See KidsHealth, NZ for information about [asthma attacks in children(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/asthma-attacks-in-children \"Open external link\").\n####    \nAn asthma attack may be mild, moderate or severe\n  * Anyone with asthma can have a severe asthma attack. \n  * An asthma attack can take anything from a few minutes to a few days to develop.\n  * Symptoms may be mild or moderate and can quickly get worse so it's important to act fast.\n  * If you have an asthma action plan follow the instructions on there.\n\n\n####    \nMild asthma symptoms\nEarly signs that asthma may be getting worse can include feeling breathless, chest tightness, cough and mild wheeze especially morning and night or when you're exercising or excited.\n####    \nModerate asthma symptoms\nWhen asthma becomes more serious, your symptoms may include:\n  * worse cough or wheeze \n  * difficulty breathing\n  * difficulty talking, you can only talk in short sentences\n  * your reliever inhaler only works for a few hours.\n\n\n#### **  \nSevere symptoms – call 111 if:**\n  * **you're gasping for breath**\n  * **you can't speak a full sentence in 1 breath**\n  * **you're blue around the mouth**\n  * **you've used a reliever inhaler but it's not helping much.**\n\n\n####  Actions to take for an asthma attack (+VIDEO) \nIf you or someone near you is having an asthma attack, follow the ASTHMA acronym. Someone having an asthma attack may not be able to follow asthma first aid themselves – they are relying on you to help. \n#### A = Assess\nAssess whether the person's asthma attack is mild, moderate or severe.\nIf the person has **severe asthma** or is frightened, call an ambulance on 111.\n#### S = Sit\nSit the person upright and stay with them. Reassure them calmly.\n#### T = Treat (with a reliever inhaler)\nIt's important to carry your reliever inhaler with you at all times. If you're helping someone else you may need to help them find one.\n  * **Symbicort or DuoResp Spiromax:** Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 12 puffs daily. These inhalers quickly reduce inflammation of your airways and help you to breathe more easily.\n  * **Ventolin or SalAir:** Always use a spacer with these inhalers. Inhale 1 puff through the spacer and take 6 breaths per puff. Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 6 puffs. For severe symptoms, use 6 puffs through the spacer, every 6 minutes until help arrives. Make sure to take 6 slow breaths for each puff.\n  * **Bricanyl** : Use 1 puff initially and repeat if needed, up to 6 puffs. \n\n\n####    \nH = Help\nIf the person is not improving, call an ambulance immediately on 111. Continue to use the reliever inhaler every few minutes until help arrives.\n#### M = Monitor\n  * If the person is improving, keep monitoring them for signs of improvement or worsening of symptoms. If necessary, repeat doses of the reliever inhaler.\n  * If the person is not improving, continue to use the reliever inhaler every few minutes until help arrives. \n\n\n####    \nA = All OK!\nWhen the person is free of wheeze, cough or breathlessness, they can return to quiet activity.\nMake sure a preventer inhaler is part of your asthma management plan. This is important to reduce the chance of this type of attack happening. This may mean a separate preventer inhaler is needed, or a combined reliever and preventer inhaler if you don't have this already.\nMake sure an asthma action plan is written up to guide you through asthma attacks in the future. Regular peak flow monitoring may be useful to reduce the chance of further asthma attacks. Read more about [peak flow monitoring](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/peak-flow-meter-asthma).\nIf symptoms come back, repeat the treatment and rest. It's always important to see your healthcare provider as soon as possible after an asthma attack.\n####    \nVideo: What to do in an asthma emergency (1:23)  \n  \n\n(Asthma New Zealand, NZ, 2023)\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Asthma in adults](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults \"Asthma in adults\")  \n[Asthma in children | Mate huango tamariki](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-children \"Asthma in children | Mate huango tamariki\")  \n[Inhaler devices](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/i/inhaler-devices \"Inhaler devices\")  \n[Asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps \"Asthma apps\")\n####  More information \n#### Action plans\n[4-stage asthma action plans(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/resources/4-stage-asthma-action-plans \"Open external link\") Asthma Foundation, NZ, [English(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/images/ARFNZ-4-Stage-Asthma-Action-Plan-2021-06-interactive.pdf \"Open external link\"), [te reo Māori(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/4-Stage-Asthma-Action-Plan-Maori.pdf \"Open external link\"), [Samoan(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/468839-4-Stage-Asthma-Action-Plan-v05-SAM-WEB_221011_143948.pdf \"Open external link\"), [Tongan(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/ARFNZ-4-Stage-Asthma-Action-Plan-2021-06-Tongan-interactive.pdf \"Open external link\"), [Simplified Chinese(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/468839-4-Stage-Asthma-Action-Plan-v02-CHS-WEB.pdf \"Open external link\")  \n  \n\n#### Brochures\n[Asthma – first aid poster(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/ASTHMA-First-aid-A3-ENG-WEB.pdf \"Open external link\")Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ [English(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/ASTHMA-First-aid-A3-ENG-WEB.pdf \"Open external link\"), [te reo Māori(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Asthma-First-Aid-Poster-Te-Reo-Maori.pdf \"Open external link\")  \n[GINA patient guide for asthma – you can control your asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/GINA-Patient-Guide-Feb-2022.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Summer holiday asthma and allergies checklist(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Summer-holiday-asthma-and-allergies-checklist.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Asthma checklist(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Asthma-Checklist.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Allergy and asthma fact sheet(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Allergy-Asthma-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Breathing and asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Breathing-Asthma-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ\n####    \nApps\n[Asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps)\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
