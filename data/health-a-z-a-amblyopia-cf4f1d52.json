A squint may be noticeable all the time, or it may come and go.   \n  \nThe eyes of newborn babies may sometimes appear to wander or be turned. But, by around 4 months of age, your baby's eyes should be straight and move together in all directions. Some babies look like they have a squint due to the wide bridge of their nose. As they grow, their features develop and this appearance goes away. But, a child with a true squint will not grow out of it.\n#### Different types of squints\nWhen one eye is straight the other may look in or out as in the picture below.  \n  \nOne eye turning inwards (called esotropia)  \n  \n\n![Young child with squint in eyes](https://healthify.nz/assets/Legacy/17226/young-child-with-squint-canva-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.png)\nImage credit: Canva\nOne eye may also look up (hypertropia) or down (hypotropia).\n####  What causes a squint? \nChildren can be born with a squint or develop it in childhood. Often, it's caused by a problem with the muscles that move the eyes, and can run in families.   \n  \nSometimes, a child may develop a squint because an eye is abnormal and there is a problem with sight.\n####  What can I do if I think my child has a squint? \nSee your family doctor if you think your baby or child has a squint.\n####  What is the treatment for a squint? \nChildren do not outgrow a squint. It's important to start treatment at an early age. Treatment might include glasses, patching, exercises, or surgery and is usually a combination of these.  \n  \nYour child will need to see an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) or an orthoptist (specialist in the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of certain eye problems).  \n  \nThe aims of treatment are:\n  * good vision in both eyes\n  * eyes that look as straight as possible\n  * both eyes working together equally.\n\n\n####  The main complication of a squint is amblyopia \nSometime, people call amblyopia a ‘lazy eye’. Amblyopia refers to reduced vision in an eye caused by abnormal development early in life, usually between birth and 7 years of age\nIt is the most common cause of poor vision in children.\nAmblyopia occurs when one eye (rarely both) is weaker and drifts inwards or upwards. About 1 in 25 children develop some degree of amblyopia.\n![Young girl with amblyopia in eyes](https://healthify.nz/assets/Legacy/18305/young-girl-with-amblyopia-canva-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.png)\nImage credit: Canva\nWith early detection and treatment, long-term vision problems can be prevented.\n####  What is amblyopia? \nWhen eyes don't line up together, the straight or straighter eye does most of the work. The eye that's not straight doesn't see as it should. It becomes weaker. It's not receiving as clear a picture as the other eye. The part of the brain responsible for vision in that eye also doesn't develop properly. This is called amblyopia.  \n  \nIf left untreated it can lead to very poor vision. After the age of 5 and a half years, it gets more difficult to reverse amblyopia. After 7 years, it is usually impossible.  \n  \nAmblyopia is the most common cause of poor vision in children.\n####  What are the causes of amblyopia? \nThe most common causes of amblyopia are:\n  * a squint\n  * refractive error (abnormal focus)\n  * ptosis (droopy eyelid)\n  * cloudiness in one eye.\n\n\n####  What is the treatment for amblyopia? (+ APPS) \nTo reverse amblyopia and bring the vision back in the weaker eye, your child's treatment will focus on making their brain use the weaker eye again.  \n  \nTreatment for amblyopia is patching and/or glasses. When treatment starts at an early age, vision often improves. \n#### Eye patching\nPatching or covering the good eye is the most common way of encouraging your child to use the weaker eye.\n![Small child wearing glasses with one lens patched](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Eye-topics/Small-child-with-glasses-and-eye-patch-canva-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\nImage credit: Canva\n  \nIf your child's treatment includes patching, their eye specialist may recommend patching either:\n  * Full-time – your child wears the patch all day every day.\n  * Part-time – for a certain number of hours a day. \n\n\nAfter a set period, your child will have a vision check.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some Vision difficulty apps.\n####  VIDEO: Amblyopia – a guide for patients \n#### Video: Lazy Eye (Amblyopia) | A guide for Patients\nThis video may take a few moments to load.\n  \n(Johns Hopkins Medicine, US, 2021)  \n  \nWatch[a video explaining amblyopia(external link)(external link)](https://youtu.be/RB31Bzgl-Jg \"Open external link\")\n####  More information \n#### Apps\n[Vision difficulty apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/v/vision-difficulty-apps)\n#### Resources\n[Squints (Strabismus)(external link)](https://www.aucklandeye.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Squints_Online-1.pdf \"Squints \\(Strabismus\\)\") Auckland Eye, NZ, 2010\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Eye examination](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eye-examination \"Eye examination\")  \n[Eye checks for children](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eye-checks-children \"Eye checks for children\")  \n[Eyes and ageing](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eyes-and-ageing \"Eyes and ageing\")  \n[Glasses for infants and children](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/g/glasses-infants-children \"Glasses for infants and children\")  \n[Eye conditions](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eye-conditions \"Eye conditions\")\n####  Information for healthcare providers \n[Vision screening for amblyopia in childhood(external link)](http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005020.pub3/full \"Open external link\")  \n[Interventions for unilateral and bilateral refractive amblyopia(external link)](http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005137.pub3/full \"Open external link\")\n#### Apps\n[Vision difficulty apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/v/vision-difficulty-apps)\n## Need help now?\n[![Healthline logo in supporters block](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Healthline-Supporters-Block__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthy.org.nz/ \"Contact Healthline \")\n[![Need to talk logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Need-to-talk-1737-logo-800x400__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://1737.org.nz/ \"Contact 1737\")\n[![Healthpoint logo](https://healthify.nz/assets/Affiliate-Images/Health-Point-logo__ResizedImageWzMwMCwxNTBd.png) ](https://www.healthpoint.co.nz/ \"Healthpoint website\")\nEmail\nCredits: KidsHealth NZ\nReviewed by: Healthify editorial team.
