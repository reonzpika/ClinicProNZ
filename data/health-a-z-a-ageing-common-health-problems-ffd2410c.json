Some people in their 80s are still as mentally and physically active as people 50 years younger. \n\n\n![Older woman sunhat glasses 950x690](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Seniors/Older-woman-sunhat-glasses-canva-950x690.jpg)\nQR Code Print\nOpen all Close all\n####  What is normal ageing? \nAs you get older your body changes, having inevitable impacts on different body systems and organs. \nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, here’s what’s happening in various parts of your body as you age, and what you can do to stay fit and healthy for longer. You can read about these changes in greater detail on the [Mayo Clinic(external link)(external link)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/healthy-aging/in-depth/aging/art-20046070 \"Open external link\") site.\n####  Cardiovascular system \nYour blood vessels and arteries become harder, meaning your heart has to work harder to pump the blood through them. This can lead to high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems.\nIt will help if you:\n  * stay physically active every day\n  * eat a healthy diet\n  * don’t smoke\n  * manage your stress\n  * get enough sleep.\n\n\nRead more about [cardiovascular health](https://healthify.nz/procare/improved-quality-of-life-for-people-living-with-ltcs/heart-health).\n####  Bones, joints and muscles \nBones tend to shrink and lose their density, meaning they become less strong and can break more easily. Muscles lose strength and become less flexible impacting on your co-ordination, balance and stability.\nIt will help if you:\n  * get plenty of [calcium](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/c/calcium \"Calcium\")\n  * get enough [vitamin D](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/v/vitamin-d \"Vitamin D\")[](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/v/vitamin-d \"Vitamin D\")\n  * Stay physically active including weight-bearing exercise\n  * [Don’t smoke](https://healthify.nz/apps/q/quitline-online-support) and limit [alcohol.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/a/alcohol \"Alcohol\")\n\n\nRead more about [bone density.](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/o/osteoporosis \"Osteoporosis\")\n![2 women doing handstands exercise against a wall ](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Exercise/two-women-exercising-in-gym-HN__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\n_Image credit: Health Navigator Charitable Trust_\n####  Digestive system \nYour large intestine changes as you age making it more likely you’ll get constipated. Being less active, not eating enough fibre and taking some medicines can make it worse. \nIt will help if you:\n  * stay physically active every day\n  * eat a healthy diet including fruit, vegetables and whole grains\n  * drink plenty of water\n  * go to the toilet when you feel the urge to have a bowel movement (poo) and don’t hold on.\n\n\nRead more about [healthy eating.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/h/healthy-eating-basics \"Healthy eating basics\")\n####  Bladder and urinary tract \nYour bladder may not stretch as much as you get older, meaning you need to urinate (wee) more often. Weakening of your bladder muscles makes it harder to completely empty your bladder and you may lose some bladder control (urinary incontinence). For men, this can be made worse by having an enlarged prostate. \nIt will help if you:\n  * empty your bladder regularly\n  * stay at a healthy weight and lose weight if you need to\n  * don’t smoke\n  * do pelvic floor exercises\n  * avoid things that can irritate your bladder, eg, [caffeine](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/c/caffeine \"Caffeine\"), acidic foods, alcohol and fizzy drinks can make incontinence worse\n  * avoid getting constipated (bowel blocked up).\n\n\nRead more about pelvic floor exercises for [men](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pelvic-floor-training-men \"Pelvic floor training – men\") and [women.](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pelvic-floor-training-women \"Pelvic floor training – women\")\n####  Memory and ability to think (cognitive abilities) \nAs your brain gets older you may find your memory isn’t as good as it was (eg, you forget names or words) or you can’t think as clearly.\nIt will help if you:\n  * stay physically active every day\n  * stay mentally active \n  * stay socially active to improve your mental wellbeing\n  * eat a healthy diet and limit alcohol as it can add to confusion\n  * don’t smoke\n  * treat cardiovascular risk factors (eg, [high blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure-high \"Hypertension\"), [high ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high \"Cholesterol - high\")[cholesterol](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high \"Cholesterol - high\") and [diabetes](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/diabetes-type-2/ \"Diabetes – type 2\")) as they may increase loss of cognitive abilities.\n\n\nRead more about [staying mentally active(external link)](https://betterhealth.vic.gov.au/healthyliving/keeping-active \"Open external link\").\n####  Eyes and ears \nYour vision and hearing can deteriorate as you age. Read more about vision problems ([cataracts](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cataract \"Cataract\"), [macular ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/m/macular-degeneration \"Macular degeneration\")[degeneration](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/m/macular-degeneration \"Macular degeneration\") and [glaucoma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/g/glaucoma \"Glaucoma\")) and [hearing loss.](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hearing-loss-in-adults \"Hearing loss in adults\")\nIt will help if you:\n  * have regular check-ups\n  * wear [sunglasses](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sunglasses-why-it-s-important-to-wear \"Sunglasses – why it’s important to wear\") and a wide-brimmed hat to protect your eyes when you’re outside\n  * wear ear plugs when you are around loud noises.\n\n\n####  Teeth \nYour gums might recede (pull back from your teeth) as you get older, and some medicines can give you a dry mouth. This makes tooth decay more likely.\nIt will help if you:\n  * brush your teeth twice a day and floss (or use an interdental cleaner) once a day\n  * have regular check-ups.\n\n\n####  Skin \nAgeing skin gets thinner,becomes more fragile and bruises more easily. It may get drier as the natural oils decrease. Wrinkles, age spots and skin tags may appear. \nIt will help if you:\n  * are gentle with your skin, bathe in warm rather than hot water, use mild soaps and moisturiser\n  * use [sunscreen](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sunscreen \"Sunscreen\") and cover up when outside\n  * don’t smoke.\n\n\n####  Weight \nYour metabolism slows down as you get older, meaning that you don’t burn calories in the same way. If you continue to eat the same amount you can put on weight. \nIt will help if you:\n  * stay physically active every day\n  * eat a healthy diet\n  * watch your portion sizes, or how much you eat.\n\n\nRead more about [serving sizes for people of different ages.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/f/food-groups-serving-size \"Food groups & serving size\")\n####  Sexuality \nYour sexual needs and enjoyment may change as you get older. Sex may become uncomfortable for women due to vaginal dryness and men may find it more difficult to get or keep an erection. \nIt will help if you:\n  * talk to your partner about what is happening for you and what you need\n  * remain physically active\n  * talk to your healthcare provider as there may be treatment that can help.\n\n\nRead more about [sex and ageing.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sex-and-ageing \"Sex and ageing\")\n####  When to seek medical advice \nAlthough some functional changes can be explained by natural ageing processes, it's important to seek advice from a healthcare provider if you have any concerns that something else might be going on. \nIf you notice changes in your patterns (sleep, bowel, appetite) or other symptoms (pain, shortness of breath) don’t assume it’s something you have to put up with just because you’re getting older. There may be a treatable reason, so talk to your healthcare provider and make a plan to improve your quality of life. \nTalk to your doctor or healthcare provider if you are experiencing any of these:\n  * frequent falls – also see [falls prevention](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/falls-and-falls-prevention)\n  * significant memory loss\n  * incontinence\n  * difficulty in walking\n  * [anxiety ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anxiety)or [depressed mood](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/depression-later-life)\n  * [painful joints](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/arthritis)\n  * change in your bowel habit such as [constipation](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/constipation-in-adults), blood in your poo (faeces, stools) or diarrhoea (runny poo)\n  * [pains in your chest](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chest-pain) or [indigestion](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/indigestion)\n  * breathing problems.\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Ageing topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ageing-topics)  \n[Eyes and ageing](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eyes-and-ageing \"Eyes and ageing\")\n####  More information \n#### Apps\n[Exercise apps for older adults](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/exercise-apps-for-older-adults)  \n[Healthy ageing and wellness apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/h/healthy-ageing-apps)  \n[Self-management and healthy living apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/h/healthy-living-apps)\n#### Resources\n[Eating for healthy older people(external link)(external link)](https://www.healthed.govt.nz/system/files/resource-files/HE1145_Eating%20for%20healthy%20older%20people_0.pdf \"Open external link\") HealthEd, NZ, 2021  \n[Physical activity for older people (65+)(external link)(external link)](http://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/physical-activity-for-older-people-factsheet-v2.pdf \"Open external link\") Ministry of Health, NZ, 2013  \n[People living in aged residential care(external link)(external link)](https://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/Our-work/Improved-service-delivery/Aged-residential-care/Publications-resources/InterRAI-infographic-Feb-2020.pdf \"Open external link\") interRAI, NZ, 2020\n#### References\n  1.
