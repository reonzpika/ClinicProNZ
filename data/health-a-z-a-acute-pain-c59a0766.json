Acute pain is pain that starts quickly (either suddenly, or over minutes or hours) and lasts a short time (from seconds to weeks).\nAcute pain is usually caused by tissue damage or inflammation from an injury or illness.\nAcute pain can be mild, moderate or severe. The word acute means how long you’ve had it, not how bad it is. It can happen anywhere in your body, and it feels different depending on what’s causing it.\n####  What is the difference between acute pain and chronic pain? (+ VIDEO) \nAcute pain starts over a short time and lasts for seconds to weeks. It goes away when the cause gets better.
