It's removed with a needle guided by ultrasound. \nConditions it can be used to check for include:\n  * [Down syndrome](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/down-syndrome)\n  * a blood condition such as [sickle cell anaemia](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaemia-sickle-cell)\n  * a medical condition affecting the brain or spinal cord, eg, [spina bifida](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/spina-bifida).\n\n\nThe results will also find out the sex of your baby.\n####  When is an amniocentesis performed? \nWhen needed, an amniocentesis is usually performed around the 15th week of pregnancy. However, if there isn’t enough fluid at that time, it could be put off for a week or two.\nThe test can be recommended by your healthcare provider if you:\n  * have had an abnormal ultrasound, or maternal serum screening test with a result suggesting there is a higher risk of your baby having a genetic condition\n  * have a family history of certain genetic conditions, eg,[cystic fibrosis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cystic-fibrosis)\n  * have already had a child/pregnancy with a genetic condition\n  * are aged 35 years or over when your baby is due.\n\n\n####  Is there any preparation needed before the test? \nYou don’t need to change the way you eat or drink before the procedure. You might want to arrange for somebody to drive you home afterwards in case you have any discomfort.\n####  What happens during an amniocentesis? \nYou will be able to have a partner or support person with you before and throughout the procedure. You will have an [ultrasound scan](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/u/ultrasound) so the doctor doing the amniocentesis can see where your baby is positioned and find the safest place to take a sample of amniotic fluid.   \n  \nYou may have the area numbed with local anaesthetic before a thin needle is inserted through the wall of your uterus into the sac containing the amniotic fluid surrounding your baby. A small amount of fluid (about 30mls) is removed. Your baby will be checked afterwards to make sure all is well.   \n  \nThe procedure should be no more painful than having a blood test, but there may be some discomfort afterwards. \n####  What happens after the amniocentesis? \nTake it easy for a day or so and get some rest. If you have any bleeding or fluid loss through your vagina, let your healthcare provider know and rest in bed until the problem resolves. There may be some soreness where the needle went in.\nContact your healthcare provider urgently if you experience any of these:\n  * Bleeding or loss of fluid through your vagina.\n  * Severe cramping lasting more than a few hours.\n  * A[fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/fever-adults)(temperature higher than 38º\n  * Redness where the needle went in.\n\n\n####  What are the risks? \nAmniocentesis is a relatively safe procedure but there are some risks:\n  * **Leaking amniotic fluid:**\n  * **Needle injury:**\n  * **Rhesus sensitization (making antibodies against your baby’s blood cells):**\n  * **Miscarriage:**\n\n\n####  Getting the results \nIt can take a couple of weeks for the results to be ready. The results will be sent to your healthcare provider who will discuss them with you.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Antenatal blood tests](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pregnancy-blood-tests \"Antenatal blood tests\")\n####  More information \n[Amniocentesis – a patient's guide(external link)](https://www.familydoctor.co.nz/categories/pregnancy-and-birth/amniocentisis-a-patients-guide/ \"Open external link\") Family Doctor, NZ\n#### Apps\n[Pregnancy apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pregnancy-apps)\n#### References\n  1.
