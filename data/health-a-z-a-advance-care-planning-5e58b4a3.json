You can then write down your thoughts in an advance care plan, which is a written record that includes your preferences for your future health care.\nAdvance care planning can be done when you are perfectly healthy and want to prepare for the worst-case scenario or because you have a long-term condition or life-threatening illness.\nThe 5 steps involved in advance care planning include thinking about, talking about, planning for, sharing and reviewing ([see below](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/advance-care-planning#five-steps)). Advance care planning is a voluntary process. \n####  What is advance care planning and why is it important? \nAdvance care planning is a process of thinking and talking about your values and goals and what your preferences are for current and future health care. Advance care planning helps you to understand what the future might hold and say what health care you would or wouldn't want, including end-of-life care. Read more about [advance care planning(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/what-is-advance-care-planning \"Open external link\").\nAdvance care planning is important because:\n  * it encourages conversation about what matters to you and your whānau\n  * it can help you and your whānau understand what is happening to your health and what that might mean for you in the future\n  * it can help you and your whānau feel more in control and reduce anxiety as you face future health events\n  * it enables you to say how you would like to be cared for if you're not able to tell people this yourself, eg, if you have advanced dementia or when something unexpected happens.\n\n\nMany people choose to write down their advance care planning wishes in an advance care plan. The [creating your plan(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan \"Open external link\") section on the advance care planning national website has lots of tools to help you think about and write down what matters most to you.   \n  \n\n![Grandmother holding grandchild on couch](https://healthify.nz/assets/Maori-and-Pasifika-people-/grandmother-cradling-newborn-baby-Canva__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.png)\n_Image credit: Canva_\n####  What is an advance care plan? \nAn advance care plan is a template where you can write down your advance care planning wishes, including the things that are important to you and the types of medical care and treatment you do or don't want to receive in the future, including at the end of your life. \nAn advance care plan tells your family and your healthcare team about the treatment and care you want if you are no longer able to tell them yourself.\nAn[advance care plan(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan#writing-your-acplan \"Open external link\") can include things such as:\n  * Who you are and what's important to you.\n  * What's happening with your health now and what you might expect might happen in the future.\n  * Your spiritual and emotional needs.\n  * How you like to make decisions and who you would like your healthcare team to talk to if you were unable to tell them your wishes yourself.\n  * Where you would like to be cared for – at home, hospice, aged care or hospital.\n  * The ways you would like those caring for you to look after you.\n  * Whether you wish to donate organs.\n  * They type of funeral you'd like.\n  * Where your important papers and documents are.\n  * Whether you have an enduring power of attorney (EPOA) or advance directive – an enduring power of attorney is someone you appoint legally to make decisions on your behalf about your personal and financial matters when you can no longer speak for yourself.

This means your healthcare team has a responsibility to take the things you have said are important to you into consideration when they're planning your care or suggesting treatment options.\n####  Who is advance care planning for? \nAdvance care planning is for everyone. Advance care planning is just as important when you are well and healthy as when you develop health problems. We all have our own unique priorities, goals and preferences that shape how we live and influence how we would like to be cared for in the future and at the end of our life. \n####  What is involved in advance care planning? (+ APPS) \n####  Thinking about\nThe first step in advance care planning is thinking about what matters to you and what you would like for your future health care. This can include things such as:\n  * your values, beliefs, priorities, worries, what helps you through tough times, and what abilities are so important to you that you can't imagine living without them. \n  * Treatments that you would or would not want and what you want your care to focus upon. \n  * Who you would want to be involved in decision about your health if you were too unwell to be part of the discussion.\n  * Where you would like to spend your last days.\n\n\nHere are some [tools to help you think about advance care planning(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan#thinkingaboutacp \"Open external link\"). \n####    \nTalking about\nOnce you have thought about what's important to you, it's a good idea to talk about them. You should involve the people you want to know about your wishes for care and treatment if you can’t tell them yourself. This could include your whānau and friends, your Enduring Power of Attorney for care and welfare if you have appointed one, your healthcare provider or specialist (particularly if you have been diagnosed with a serious illness) and other members of your healthcare team.\n####    \nPlanning for\nWhen you know what's important to you and what you want others to know in the future, it's a good idea to write it down for your whānau and healthcare team to refer to in the future if you can't tell them yourself. \n[Tools to help you write down your wishes(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan#writing-your-acplan \"Open external link\") can be found on the advance care planning website. \nRemember, you don’t need to complete every section in the 'My advance care plan and guide booklet', just those that feel relevant to you. \n####    \nSharing\nOnce you have made your plan, make sure you share it with your key whānau members, Enduring Power of Attorney and your healthcare team. It's important your whānau and other loved ones know you have a plan and where the plan is kept. In many parts of the country, you can ask for your plan to be added to your medical record.

People find it useful to decide on a day to review it every year, such as their birthday, Labour day or the time the clocks go back for winter. Every time you make a change, let your healthcare team and anyone who has a copy of your advance care plan know.\n####    \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [falls prevention apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/f/falls-prevention-apps) and [long-term condition apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/l/long-term-condition-apps).\n####  VIDEOS: Personal stories \n#### Video: Arthur Te Anini's story (English subtitles)\n  \nArthur Te Anini has written an advance care plan for his future health and end-of-life care.
