See asthma in adults\n  * The content on this page comes from [KidsHealth(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/asthma \"Open external link\").\n\n\n![Boy using inhaler with spacer](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Respiratory/Boy-using-inhaler-with-spacer-ARFNZ-950x690.png)\nQR Code Print\nOpen all Close all\n####  What is asthma? \nAsthma is a common breathing condition. It affects the small and medium-sized airways (bronchi) in the lungs. \nIn asthma, your child's airways are inflamed and there is:\n  * swelling of the airway wall\n  * an increase in mucus or phlegm\n  * tightening of the muscle in the airway wall.\n\n\nThese changes cause narrowing of your child's airways. This leads to wheezing, cough and difficulty with breathing.\nWheezing is a musical, whistly sound that tamariki make, usually when breathing out. It can also happen when they breathe in. The sound comes from their chest, not from their nose or throat.\nThe image below shows a normal airway and the airway of a person with asthma.\n![Image showing normal lung and airway and that of a person with asthma](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Respiratory/Bronchoconstriction-Blausen-Medical-wikimedia-commons-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.png)\n_Image credit: Blausen Medical Gallery 2014 via[Wikimedia Commons(external link)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0 \"Open external link\")_\n####  Why do some children have asthma? \nOne in 4 tamariki in Aotearoa New Zealand will have asthma at some time during childhood. It's not clear why some children have asthma when others don't.\nAsthma in children is more likely if:\n  * a mother smoked during pregnancy \n  * a child has [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema-children), [hay fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever) or allergies\n  * there is asthma in the family – parent, brother or sister\n  * one or both parents have an allergic condition, eg, asthma, hay fever or eczema.\n\n\nModern Western lifestyle may play a part in the rise in asthma that has happened over the last few decades. Changes in housing, diet and a more hygienic environment may contribute. Outdoor environmental pollution may make asthma symptoms worse but it doesn't actually cause asthma. Experts continue to study the reasons for the increase in asthma. \n####  What causes an asthma attack? \nTamariki and rangatahi with asthma have airways that are sensitive and react to certain triggers. Some children have asthma all year round. Others may only have it in certain seasons or situations. \nThings that can cause an attack include the following:\n  * **Infections:** Viruses like colds and the flu can cause some children to have worse asthma symptoms which may lead to an asthma attack.\n  * **Allergies:** If your child is allergic to things like pollens, grass, dust or pet fur, this can worsen their asthma. \n  * **Irritants:** Irritants may trigger asthma attacks. Examples or irritants are air pollution, car exhaust, vapours and mouldy environments.\n  * **Tobacco smoke:** Tobacco smoke can trigger asthma attacks and can make your child's asthma symptoms worse. All tamariki need a smoke-free environment, wherever they happen to be.\n  * **Exercise:** Exercise and physical activity are a big part of helping tamariki stay healthy and fit. Exercise is also an important part of asthma management. But, sometimes exercise or activity can trigger an episode of asthma.\n  * **Changes in the weather:** Some children may find a change in the weather or certain conditions, like cold or damp weather, can make their asthma worse.\n\n\n####  How can I prevent my child from having asthma attacks? \n#### Medicine\nSome tamariki need to be on a preventer medicine. \nSee our page on the [different types of asthma medicines](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/asthma-reliever-medicine) and when to use them.\nOther things that can help your child's asthma include:\n  * living in a smoke-free environment at all times\n  * keeping your house warm and dry\n  * where possible, avoiding things that trigger their asthma.\n\n\n#### Be smoke-free\nMake sure your child's environment is [smoke-free](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smokefree-for-your-children), wherever they happen to be. Asthma increases in tamariki whose parents smoke. Tobacco smoke also triggers asthma attacks and makes a child's asthma more severe. Many environmental factors contribute to asthma. Cigarette smoke is one that you can avoid.\nIf you want to give up smoking:\n  * call the free Quitline on 0800 778 778 or text 4006\n  * check out the [Quitline | Me Mutu website(external link)](https://quit.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n  * ask your healthcare provider for support.\n\n\n#### Keep your house warm and dry\nCheck out our useful tips for [keeping your home warm and dry](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/w/winter-how-to-keep-your-home-warm-in-winter).\n#### Keep a symptom diary and a record of possible triggers\nAsthma symptoms and triggers may differ from child to child and from time to time. It is useful to know your child's triggers. Use a [symptom diary](https://healthify.nz/tools/s/symptom-diary) to keep a record of possible triggers.\n####  Could my child have asthma? \nYou should see your healthcare provider and ask about asthma if your child:\n  * wheezes and coughs with a cold (virus)\n  * wheezes and coughs after exercise\n  * wheezes and coughs during the night\n  * can't keep up when they're running around with children of the same age\n  * says they are out of breath or breathless\n  * complains they feel tired or asks you to carry them (depending on their age) when you go for a walk\n  * doesn't run around as much as other children of the same age.\n\n\nThese are some of the symptoms of asthma in children, but they may also be due to other less common conditions. Talk to your healthcare provider about them.\n####  What if my child does have asthma? \n#### Asthma medicines\nRead about [different types of asthma medicines.](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/asthma-medication)\n#### Online learning tool\nYou can use the[Asthma + Respiratory Foundation NZ's online learning tool(external link)](https://learnaboutlungs.asthmaandrespiratory.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") to learn more about how you can help children with asthma stay fit, healthy and happy.\n[![Screenshot of Asthma + Respiratory Foundation interactive resource](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/sites/kidshealth/files/images/Asthma%20interactive%20resource%20small.png)(external link)](https://learnaboutlungs.asthmaandrespiratory.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n#### Booklets to download\nYou can read the following translated booklets alongside the online learning tool above. \n[Read a booklet about managing your child's asthma in te reo Māori (PDF, 3.06 MB)(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/MYCA-MAO-Web.pdf \"Open external link\")  \n[Read a booklet about managing your child's asthma in English (PDF, 3.59 MB)(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Managing-your-childs-asthma.pdf \"Open external link\")  \n[Read a booklet about managing your child's asthma in Samoan (PDF, 3.05 MB)(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/14957_Asthma-Booklet_022_SAM.PDF \"Open external link\")\n#### Videos to watch\nYou can also watch some videos from KidsHealth NZ about [managing asthma in children and young people(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/managing-asthma-children-young-people \"Open external link\").\n####  How do I treat my child's asthma attack?

The majority of children with asthma have less troublesome asthma as teenagers. Symptoms can appear again in adulthood. If your child has severe asthma, it's more likely to continue or return in later life.\nYour child should learn about asthma and gradually take over responsibility for its management, as they become a teenager, with support from you.
