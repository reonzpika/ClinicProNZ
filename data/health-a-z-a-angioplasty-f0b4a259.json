It keeps the blood vessel open and allows blood to flow more freely.\n\n\n![Two men socialising in South Auckland](https://healthify.nz/assets/Maori-and-Pasifika-people-/Two-men-socialising-HN.png)\nQR Code Print\n####  What is angioplasty and when is it performed? \n#### What is it?\nAngioplasty is a procedure to widen a blocked or narrowed coronary artery to improve blood flow to your heart.\n####    \nWhen is it done?\nAngioplasty is done if the blood vessels to your heart (coronary arteries) are blocked or narrowed from a build-up of cholesterol and other substances (called plaque). This condition is known as [atherosclerosis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/atherosclerosis) which can cause [coronary artery disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/coronary-artery-disease).\nThe main symptoms of the blockage or narrowing are chest pain ([angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina)) or shortness of breath. While angina can often be treated with medicines, a coronary angioplasty may be needed in severe cases where medicines aren't enough. After an angioplasty, many people find their symptoms get better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.\nAngioplasty is also done as an emergency treatment after a heart attack, when blood flow to a section of heart muscle becomes blocked.\nAngioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis).\n####  What happens in an angioplasty (+ VIDEO) \nCoronary angioplasty is done by an interventional cardiologist (heart doctor) in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory of a hospital. A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure. You will be given sedating medicines to make you sleepy and relaxed.\n  * The start of the procedure is the same as for a [coronary angiogram](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/coronary-angiography).\n  * A catheter (which is a fine, flexible hollow tube), will be passed into an artery in either your groin or arm. A wire with a small, inflatable balloon at its tip is passed up the catheter. A fine wire mesh tube called a stent sits on the outside of the balloon.\n  * Your doctor will then use X-ray screening to direct the wire into a coronary artery until its tip reaches a narrow or blocked section. The balloon is then gently inflated.\n  * The stent expands with the balloon. As the balloon is inflated, it opens the stent against the artery walls.\n  * The balloon is deflated and removed.\n  * The stent stays in the artery to flatten the plaque against the artery wall, opening the artery to allow blood to flow more easily.\n  * During this time you may experience mild chest pain as the blood supply to the heart muscle is temporarily interrupted. It's important to let your doctor know if this happens.\n\n\nStents can be bare metal stents or drug eluting stents, which are coated in medicines to stop the artery blocking again. Your cardiologist will discuss with you which type of stent is the best for you.\nSometimes no stent is used and the balloon alone is used to press on the plaque and open the artery. This is called balloon angioplasty.\nThe image shows a catheter, balloon and stent placed into a coronary artery. \n![Angioplasty image showing artery stent, catheter and balloon](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Cardiac/Angioplasty-image-showing-arter-stent-catheter-guide-wire-and-balloon-Bruce-Blaus-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.jpg)   \n_Image credit:[Blausen Medical Communications, Inc.(external link)(external link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blausen_medical \"en:Blausen medical\")_\n#### Video: Heart stents – what you need to know\nThis video provides lots of information about angioplasty and coronary stents. It may take a few moments to load.  \n  \n\n(Heart Matters, Australia, 2021)\nA [shorter video on coronary angioplasty(external link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9VY6FSIr64 \"Open external link\") can be watched on YouTube. \n####  How to prepare for angioplasty \nThere will be a routine examination and some tests before the procedure, eg, blood tests and an [electrocardiogram](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/electrocardiograph-ecg) (ECG). A healthcare provider will explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. \nIf you're are taking medicines (especially [dabigatran](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/dabigatran), [rivaroxaban](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/r/rivaroxaban) or [warfarin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/w/warfarin)), your healthcare provider will advise you on whether to continue or stop taking it. You should take all your medicines to hospital with you.\n####  After the procedure \nWhen you return to the ward the nursing staff will monitor you closely until you're fully recovered. If the catheter was in your groin, it's usually removed about 2 to 4 hours after you get back to the ward. If the catheter was in your arm, it will be removed at the end of the procedure. \nIt's normal to have some bruising around the site and for it to be slightly tender. If you experience discomfort at the site, inform the nurse and you will be given pain relief. You may feel a small lump where the catheter was inserted, but this should disappear over the next few months. If this increases in size or becomes painful, seek medical advice.\n####  Before leaving hospital \nBefore you go home, a nurse will teach you how to check the site for bleeding and explain what to do if this happens. You'll be advised not to do any heavy lifting or straining for about a week. This is to prevent bleeding from the insertion site.\nAfter an angioplasty you may go home that evening or stay the night in hospital and go home the following day. You will need to arrange for someone to take you home.\nBefore leaving hospital you'll be started on medicines, which must be continued when you go home. These will help prevent further heart problems. To prevent blood clots forming, you'll be given medicines including[aspirin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/aspirin-low-dose \"Aspirin\")[clopidogrel](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/c/clopidogrel \"Clopidogrel\")[ticagrelor](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/ticagrelor \"Ticagrelor\"). You should also take cholesterol-lowering medications ([statins](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/statins \"Statins\")) which help protect you from further narrowings in the heart arteries and often you will also be prescribed medicines to lower your blood pressure. Always follow your doctor's instructions and don't stop taking any medicines without talking to your healthcare provider first.\n####  Getting the most from your angioplasty \nAfter an angioplasty most people return to normal, everyday activities within 1–2 days of returning home, and can usually return to work after a week.\nRemember that having an angioplasty is not a cure for heart disease. Your symptoms may have stopped, but you will still need to make, and maintain, changes to your lifestyle to prevent the [angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina) returning. The best way to prevent further heart disease is to reduce or remove any risk factors. Every risk factor you reduce or remove can have a major effect on lowering your chances of having further heart disease problems, eg, angina or a heart attack. \nLearn more about: \n  * [stopping smoking](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-topics)\n  * [exercise and physical activity](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/e/exercise-how-to-get-moving-more-every-day)\n  * [eating and drinking for a healthy heart(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/wellbeing/healthy-eating/eating-for-a-healthy-heart \"Open external link\")\n  * [reaching a healthy weight.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/w/weight-loss \"Weight loss\")\n\n\nYou may also be invited to go on a [cardiac rehabilitation programme](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/h/heart-disease-cardiac-rehabilitation).\n####  When can I drive again? \nThe New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA)[cardiovascular guide(external link)](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/ \"Open external link\") states you mustn't drive for at least 2 days after an angioplasty.\nIf you have complications from the procedure, or you have had a heart attack resulting in angioplasty, you must not drive until you have been given medical clearance – this is generally 2 weeks for a car licence.\nIf you hold a vocational licence (eg, you drive passenger vehicles, trucks, forklifts, courier vans or fly aeroplanes) different rules apply. Your licence needs to be approved by a cardiologist or specialist who will examine you and make sure it's safe for you to drive.\nIt also pays to check with your insurance company to ensure you're fully covered.\n####  Are there any risks or complications of angioplasty? \nAll types of surgery have a risk of complications, but the risk of serious problems is small. Coronary angioplasty doesn't involve major surgery and doctors describe it as a minimally invasive form of treatment.\n####    \nRisk factors\nOverall, the risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is small, but this depends on factors such as:\n  * whether the procedure was planned or was an emergency treatment\n  * your age\n  * your general health\n  * whether you've had a heart attack.\n\n\nYour healthcare provider can give you more information about your individual risks and benefits.\n####    \nPossible complications\n  * It's quite common to have some discomfort, bleeding or bruising under the skin where the catheter was inserted.\n  * Some people may be allergic to the contrast agent used during the procedure. \n  * More serious complications are less common but can include damage to the artery where the angioplasty was done, severe bleeding requiring a blood transfusion or a heart attack, heart rhythm problems, kidney problems, stroke or death.\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina \"Angina\")  \n[Heart failure | Manawa ngoikore](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-failure \"Heart failure | Manawa ngoikore\")  \n[](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-attack \"Heart attack | Hē manawa\")[Heart attack | Hē manawa](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-attack \"Heart attack | Hē manawa\")\n####  More information \n[Angioplasty – explained(external link)](http://watchlearnlive.heart.org/CVML_Player.php?moduleSelect=angiop \"Open external link\")Watch, learn, live – interactive cardiovascular library – American Heart Association  \n[Coronary stent – explained(external link)](http://watchlearnlive.heart.org/CVML_Player.php?moduleSelect=cstent \"Open external link\") Watch, learn, live – interactive cardiovascular library – American Heart Association\n#### Resources\n  \n[A guide to coronary angiography & angioplasty(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/coronary-angiography-and-angioplasty-2019.pdf?mtime=1667526706?1669351478 \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ\n#### References\n  1.
