It causes differences in communication, social skills and behaviour.\nAutism shows up in many ways. We use the term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to describe the full range of symptoms and behaviours, from mild to extreme.\nPeople with ASD have a wide range of challenges and strengths that can vary with age and over time.\nSome people find out they have ASD as a tamaiti (child), while others may not find out until they're an adult.\n####  What causes autism? \nWe don't know exactly what causes autism. Research shows that genetic factors are important.\n####  What are the symptoms of autism in adults? \nCommon signs of autism in adults include:\n  * Engaging differently in social situations, such as: \n    * avoiding or feeling uncomfortable with eye contact\n    * finding it hard to make or keep friends, or preferring to be on your own\n    * being very honest and transparent, which may make other people misinterpret you as being rude or not interested in them\n    * finding it hard to understand what others are thinking or feeling\n    * missing cues within conversation, such as body language, or whose turn it is\n    * finding it hard to say how you feel\n    * not understanding sarcasm or phrases such as 'break a leg' and taking things literally.\n  * Having repetitive behaviours or urges to move that seem unrelated to what's going on. These may increase if you're stressed, anxious or excited.\n  * Preferring order, rules and routines and finding it hard to cope with change.\n  * Experiencing sensations such as smell, touch, taste, texture, hearing and pain at a different level to others (either a higher or a lower level).\n  * Being able to focus on certain tasks or interests very closely and understand them in great detail.\n\n\n![Young woman in rainbow top smiles at rainbow light in her window](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Mental-health/Young-woman-with-autism-Canva-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\n_Image credit: Canva_\nWomen with autism are more likely to:\n  * have learned to hide signs of autism by copying people who don't have autism and suppressing some of the above signs\n  * be quieter and hide their feelings\n  * appear to cope better with social situations\n  * show fewer signs of repetitive behaviours or suppress them when with other people.\n\n\n####  How is autism in adults diagnosed? \nIf you suspect that you may have autism, you may like to take a[screening test(external link)](https://psychology-tools.com/test/raads-14).
