It's a similar size to a small mobile phone and can be clipped to your belt or waistband, carried in your pocket or in a pouch.\n  * Insulin pumps consist of the pump itself, a disposable reservoir to store the insulin, and a disposable infusion set.\n  * The infusion set includes the tubing that connects the pump to a smaller fine tube (or cannula) which sits just under your skin. Read more about [how an insulin pump works](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/insulin-pumps#how-does-an-insulin-pump-work).\n  * An insulin pump continuously releases small amounts of [rapid acting insulin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/i/insulin) to keep your blood glucose levels steady between meals and during sleep. (This replaces the long-acting insulin that most people inject once a day).\n  * The pump is also used to release insulin to your body when needed, such as during a meal or snack, to help manage your glucose levels.\n\n\nUsing an insulin pump can improve blood glucose management and reduce the number of severe hypoglycaemic events for people with type 1 diabetes compared to multiple daily injections.\nIt's important to remember that you must continue to check glucose levels using a [continuous glucose monitor (CGM)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/continuous-glucose-monitoring) or glucose meter.\nFrom 1 October 2024 Pharmac has made it easier to access insulin pumps in people who meet their criteria and have been assessed by a specialist diabetes services. \nThere are 2 insulin pumps which are funded – mylife YpsoPump and Tandem t:slim pump.

The infusion set includes the tubing that connects the pump to a fine tube (or cannula) which sits just under your skin.\nAn automated insulin delivery system (AID) is when the pump is used together with a CGM **plus** an algorithm, that links the 2 devices together, enabling them to “talk” to each other. In this way, the pump can receive blood glucose readings from a CGM and calculate how much insulin to deliver based on your current and predicted glucose values. Read more about [automated insulin delivery (AID) system](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/insulin-pumps#automated-insulin-delivery-system).\n#### How is the insulin pump connected to my body?\nThe pump is connected to your body through an infusion set, so the insulin can be delivered.\n  * The infusion set is a thin plastic tube that’s connected to a fine tube (or cannula) which sits just under your skin.\n  * The tube is inserted where you would give insulin injections, and is designed to be pain free.\n  * The tube needs to be changed every 3 days.\n  * You can remove the tubing when you have a bath, go swimming, or when you play sports. \n  * The plastic tube is also called 'insulin pump consumables'.\n\n\n#### How is insulin delivered through the pump?\nThe insulin pump holds insulin. An insulin pump is designed to copy how your pancreas would naturally release insulin. Insulin pump users deliver almost all of their insulin through their pump.\n  * The pump is programmed to give insulin at a continuous low rate during the day and night. This is called background insulin or basal insulin.\n  * It's also used to give additional insulin at mealtimes, by entering the number of grams of carbohydrate you've eaten into the pump. The pump then delivers extra insulin for meals – this is called bolus insulin. The insulin pump will also deliver extra insulin if glucose levels are too high. These are known as corrections.\n\n\n####  What is an automated insulin delivery (AID) system? \nAn automated insulin delivery system is made up of an insulin pump **plus** a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) **plus** an algorithm that links the 2 devices together, enabling them to “talk” to each other.\n  * An AID is like a standard insulin pump with one major difference – they have algorithms that can receive blood glucose readings from a CGM and calculate how much basal insulin to deliver based on your current and predicted glucose values.\n  * When a bolus dose is needed for a meal and/or correction, these systems also have calculators that can suggest a bolus amount.\n  * Bolus delivery is not automatic, manual programming and delivery is needed just like a standard insulin pump.\n\n\nThe automatic adjustments help to keep your glucose in the target range. You would still need to prompt the pump to deliver bolus doses for meals and adjust for exercise.\nIn New Zealand, AIDs are now funded for people who meet specific criteria, and have had an assessment by a specialist diabetes services.\n####  Who can get a funded insulin pump? \nIn Aotearoa New Zealand you are eligible to get a funded insulin pump if you have:\n  * type 1 diabetes\n  * permanent neonatal diabetes (diabetes since you were born)\n  * some types of “monogenic diabetes” with insulin deficiency\n  * type 3c diabetes, which includes insulin deficiency caused by pancreatectomy, cystic fibrosis related diabetes or pancreatitis\n  * some atypical inherited forms of diabetes.\n\n\nAND your diabetes specialist team agree:\n  * an insulin pump is right for you, and\n  * you will benefit from an automated insulin delivery (AID) system.\n\n\nA specialist diabetes service includes many health professionals who are trained to assist people living with diabetes.

From 1 October 2026 the consumables for the MiniMed 770G insulin pump will no longer be funded. Read more about [Medtronic (MiniMed 770G) insulin pumps – what's changing(external link)](https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/cgms-and-insulin-pumps/who-can-get-an-insulin-pump/medtronic-insulin-pumps-whats-changing \"Open external link\"). \n####  How can I learn how to use my insulin pump? \nYour diabetes specialist team will offer you the training and support you need to get the most from an insulin pump and CGM.\nThe suppliers of the insulin pumps are offering phone support from 1st October 2024.\n  * Tandem t:slim x2 (supplier: NZMS): 0508 634 103\n  * mylife YpsoPump (supplier: Pharmaco): 0800 458 267\n\n\n####    \nProblems with the insulin pumps and CGMs\n  * **Faulty insulin pumps:** If the insulin pump is faulty, or an issue develops, you will need to contact the supplier.\n  * **Faulty CGMs:** If you're having trouble with your CGM or think it may be faulty, contact the supplier or your pharmacy for help. If it's faulty, the suppliers will provide you a replacement free of charge. Any CGMs provided to replace faulty ones would not count towards your annual limit.\n  * **Broken or lost insulin pumps:** If your insulin pump is broken or lost, talk to the supplier about your options. But be aware that you may need to pay for a replacement. Pharmac funds 1 new insulin pump every 4 years which is the warranty period on insulin pumps. You may be able to claim a broken or lost insulin pump on your household insurance.\n  * **Broken or lost CGMs:** There's a limit on the total number of CGMs you can have each year that takes this into account. If you’ve used more than the limit, you may need to pay for more CGMs. Check how many CGMs you can get.\n\n\n####    \nAlways be prepared\n  * **Ask your healthcare provider about an action plan so you know what to do if your insulin pump stops working.** If this happens, contact the helpline of the insulin pump supplier for a replacement and let your diabetes nurse specialist know. You should get a back-up pump within 24h. In the meantime, give yourself insulin using an insulin pen within 4 hours of the pump stopping guided by your pump records.\n  * **Ensure you have enough insulin for emergencies.** As part of your emergency planning, you should have any medication or equipment supply for at least three days. The Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump has a rechargeable battery, which needs power to re-charge. The mylife YpsoPump uses AAA batteries. It's a good idea to keep spare batteries and some charging packs for your phone and your pump in your grab bag and make sure you also have spare consumables.\n\n\n#### Travelling with diabetes\n  * [Diabetes and travelling(external link)](https://www.diabetes.org.nz/managing-diabetes-travelling-2 \"Open external link\") Diabetes New Zealand\n  * [Navigating airport security screening: Guidance for people living with diabetes(external link)](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/assets/passenger/posters-and-flyers/AvSec-Diabetes-Guidance.pdf \"Open external link\") Aviation Security Service, NZ\n  * [Travelling with children who have diabetes(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/diabetes/travelling-with-children-who-have-diabetes \"Open external link\") KidsHealth NZ\n  * [Travel(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-travel.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n  * [Travel and type 1 diabetes(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/resources/booklet-young-people-travel-type1-diabetes.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n\n\n#### Disposing of your insulin pump\nInsulin pumps consist of the pump itself, a disposable reservoir to store the insulin, and a disposable infusion set.

Read more about [Medtronic (MiniMed 770G) insulin pumps – what's changing(external link)](https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/cgms-and-insulin-pumps/who-can-get-an-insulin-pump/medtronic-insulin-pumps-whats-changing \"Open external link\"). \n####  How can I learn how to use my insulin pump? \nYour diabetes specialist team will offer you the training and support you need to get the most from an insulin pump and CGM.\nThe suppliers of the insulin pumps are offering phone support from 1st October 2024.\n  * Tandem t:slim x2 (supplier: NZMS): 0508 634 103\n  * mylife YpsoPump (supplier: Pharmaco): 0800 458 267\n\n\n####    \nProblems with the insulin pumps and CGMs\n  * **Faulty insulin pumps:** If the insulin pump is faulty, or an issue develops, you will need to contact the supplier.\n  * **Faulty CGMs:** If you're having trouble with your CGM or think it may be faulty, contact the supplier or your pharmacy for help. If it's faulty, the suppliers will provide you a replacement free of charge. Any CGMs provided to replace faulty ones would not count towards your annual limit.\n  * **Broken or lost insulin pumps:** If your insulin pump is broken or lost, talk to the supplier about your options. But be aware that you may need to pay for a replacement. Pharmac funds 1 new insulin pump every 4 years which is the warranty period on insulin pumps. You may be able to claim a broken or lost insulin pump on your household insurance.\n  * **Broken or lost CGMs:** There's a limit on the total number of CGMs you can have each year that takes this into account. If you’ve used more than the limit, you may need to pay for more CGMs. Check how many CGMs you can get.\n\n\n####    \nAlways be prepared\n  * **Ask your healthcare provider about an action plan so you know what to do if your insulin pump stops working.** If this happens, contact the helpline of the insulin pump supplier for a replacement and let your diabetes nurse specialist know. You should get a back-up pump within 24h. In the meantime, give yourself insulin using an insulin pen within 4 hours of the pump stopping guided by your pump records.\n  * **Ensure you have enough insulin for emergencies.** As part of your emergency planning, you should have any medication or equipment supply for at least three days. The Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump has a rechargeable battery, which needs power to re-charge. The mylife YpsoPump uses AAA batteries. It's a good idea to keep spare batteries and some charging packs for your phone and your pump in your grab bag and make sure you also have spare consumables.\n\n\n#### Travelling with diabetes\n  * [Diabetes and travelling(external link)](https://www.diabetes.org.nz/managing-diabetes-travelling-2 \"Open external link\") Diabetes New Zealand\n  * [Navigating airport security screening: Guidance for people living with diabetes(external link)](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/assets/passenger/posters-and-flyers/AvSec-Diabetes-Guidance.pdf \"Open external link\") Aviation Security Service, NZ\n  * [Travelling with children who have diabetes(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/diabetes/travelling-with-children-who-have-diabetes \"Open external link\") KidsHealth NZ\n  * [Travel(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-travel.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n  * [Travel and type 1 diabetes(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/resources/booklet-young-people-travel-type1-diabetes.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n\n\n#### Disposing of your insulin pump\nInsulin pumps consist of the pump itself, a disposable reservoir to store the insulin, and a disposable infusion set. The insulin pump insertion needle (not the tubing) must be disposed of in a sharps bin.
