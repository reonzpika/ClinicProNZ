This may happen throughout your body or in one tissue or organ. Organs often affected include your heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract (gut), nervous system or skin. \n####  Who is most at risk of getting amyloidosis? \nAmyloidosis generally affects people who are middle-aged and older, although it can occur in people from their thirties.Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.  \n  \nOther health conditions can increase the risk of amyloidosis. About 10–15% of people with multiple myeloma develop amyloidosis. Long-term kidney dialysis may increase the risk of dialysis-associated amyloidosis.\n####  What are the types of amyloidosis? (+ VIDEO) \n#### Video: Amyloidosis; AA, AL, TTRwt (wild type) and TTR hereditary\nThis video may take a few moments to load.\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis, but there are 3 main types.\n  \n(New Zealand Amyloidosis Patients Association, 2021)\n#### Primary amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis)\nPrimary amyloidosis is a disorder of protein metabolism that begins in your bone marrow. It is sometimes associated with multiple myeloma. Primary amyloidosis affects your heart, kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract (gut), central nervous system and skin. \n#### Secondary systemic amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis)\nSecondary systemic amyloidosis occurs as a complication of many chronic inflammatory diseases such as[rheumatoid arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid arthritis\"),[tuberculosis (TB)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/t/tuberculosis \"Tuberculosis\")AA amyloidosis may improve with treatment of the underlying condition.\n#### Familial (hereditary) amyloidosis\nFamilial amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis that is inherited. It most commonly causes cardiomyopathy (a condition that makes it harder for your heart muscle to pump blood to the rest of your body)\n####  What are the symptoms of amyloidosis? \nYou may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until the condition is advanced. When you do have symptoms, they depend on the organ or system affected.   \n  \nThey may include:\n  * [extreme tiredness (fatigue)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/fatigue \"Tiredness & fatigue\")\n  * weight loss\n  * easy bruising\n  * [breathlessness](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/breathlessness \"Breathlessness\")\n  * swelling of your ankles and legs\n  * numbness, tingling or pain in your hands or feet, especially pain in your wrist ([carpal tunnel syndrome](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/carpal-tunnel-syndrome \"Carpal tunnel syndrome\"))\n  * skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around your eyes\n  * an enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge\n  * runny poo ([diarrhoea](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/diarrhoea \"Diarrhoea\")), possibly with blood in the poo, or[constipation](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/constipation-in-adults \"Constipation\") (hard poo).\n\n\n####  How is amyloidosis diagnosed? \nIf you have the above symptoms see your doctor. Amyloidosis is diagnosed by biopsy, where a tissue sample is taken from the affected organ so it can be examined closely. Specialised testing of the tissue can help work out the type of abnormal protein involved.\n####  How is amyloidosis treated? (+ APPS) \nThere is no cure for amyloidosis. However, treatment can help manage symptoms and limit more amyloid protein being produced, therefore limiting further damage to the affected organ. If the amyloidosis has been triggered by another condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or TB, treating the underlying condition can help.\nMany of the same types of medicines used to treat some forms of cancer are used in AL amyloidosis. These stop the growth of abnormal cells that produce the protein leading to the amyloid forming.\n#### Support\n[NZ Amyloidosis Patients Association(external link)(external link)](https://amyloidosis.co.nz/ \"Open external link\") Awareness, advocacy and support for people with amyloidosis and their carers.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps) and [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Rheumatoid arthritis | Mate rumatiki](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid arthritis | Mate rumatiki\")  \n[TB](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/t/tuberculosis)  \n[Rare disorders](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rare-disorders \"Rare disorders\")\n####  More information \n[Amyloidosis(external link)(external link)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyloidosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353178 \"Open external link\") Mayo Clinic, US\n#### References\n  1.
