It usually occurs quickly after exposure to something the person is allergic to, and is potentially life threatening.\n  * Someone having anaphylaxis needs immediate treatment and medical attention.\n  * Life-threatening symptoms are those that affect your airways making it hard to breathe, or your circulation system, causing dizziness or collapse.\n  * Signs to watch for are: \n    * difficult/noisy breathing\n    * swelling of the tongue\n    * swelling or tightness in the throat\n    * difficulty talking or hoarse voice\n    * wheeze or persistent cough\n    * persistent dizziness or collapse\n    * pale and floppy (young children)\n    * abdominal pain or diarrhoea (can be a sign of anaphylaxis in bee/wasp sting reaction).\n\n\n**Treat anaphylaxis immediately by following the steps below.**\n####  **If you or someone you care for experiences the following symptoms, give adrenaline if available and call 111 for an ambulance:**  \n  \n\n  1. **Lie the person down**\n  2. **Remove any trigger**\n  3. **Give adrenaline**\n  4. **Call 111 for an ambulance**. Stay with them until the ambulance arrives.\n\n**Notes:**\n  * If there is no adrenaline on hand, follow the other 3 steps\n  * Don’t get up even if you feel better after having adrenaline, wait for the ambulance.\n\n*The instructions will be on the side of the EpiPen, and the person may have an Anaphylaxis Action Plan with the EpiPen.  \n---  \n####  What are the causes of anaphylaxis? \nAnaphylaxis is a serious whole body allergic response to exposure to an allergen. It's an over-reaction by your immune system to the allergen trigger. It can make your airways tighten, which restricts your breathing, or affect the circulation of blood in your body, and it can be life threatening.\nAn allergen can be anything, but common triggers of anaphylaxis include:\n  * food\n  * insect venom\n  * medicines.\n\n\nIn some cases, the cause may take some time to be identified.\n#### Food\n  * Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, sesame, fish, shellfish, wheat and soy are the most common food triggers, and cause 90% of allergic reactions. However, any food can trigger anaphylaxis.\n  * In some cases, mild or moderate allergic symptoms can happen before the above symptoms, such as\n  * swelling of your face, lips or eyes\n  * hives, welts or body redness\n  * tingling of your mouth\n  * tummy pain or vomiting (being sick).\n  * Having asthma can also increase the risk of having a severe reaction if you accidentally eat even a small amount of the food you are allergic to.\n\n\n####    \nInsect venom\nBee and wasp stings are the most common causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings in Aotearoa New Zealand.\n####    \nMedicines\nBoth over-the-counter and prescribed medicines, such as antibiotics or painkillers, can cause life-threatening allergic reactions. You can also have anaphylactic reactions to herbal or alternative medicines. Anaesthetics and contrast agents used in imaging tests can also cause anaphylaxis.\n####    \nOther causes\nOther triggers such as latex or exercise-induced anaphylaxis are less common. Occasionally the trigger can't be identified. \n####  How is anaphylaxis diagnosed? \nAnaphylaxis may be diagnosed following a severe reaction for which you went to an emergency department at the hospital. \nYour healthcare provider will ask you questions related to your symptoms, examine you and do some tests to find out your triggers, and/or rule out other conditions that can be similar to anaphylaxis, such as fainting, severe asthma attacks or panic attacks. \nTests that may be done include:\n  * blood test to look for an antibody called IgE or an enzyme called mast cell tryptase\n  * skin prick testing to find out triggers.\n\n\nYou may also be diagnosed as at risk of anaphylaxis because of an allergy you have been diagnosed with e.g. to a food, even though you may only have had mild to moderate reactions to it previously. \nIf you are diagnosed at risk of anaphylaxis, your doctor or nurse specialist will give you an[anaphylaxis action plan(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_EpiPen_2025.pdf \"Open external link\")\n####  How is anaphylaxis managed? \nAnaphylaxis is a preventable and treatable event. Knowing the trigger(s) is the first step in prevention. Everyone at risk needs to know how to avoid food allergens and/or other triggers. \nHowever, because accidental exposure is possible, you and your child need to be able to recognise symptoms of anaphylaxis and be prepared to give adrenaline according to your anaphylaxis action plan.\n#### How to position a child or an adult having a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)\nPlease**click the image below** and scroll down on the new page to play the animation.\n[![](https://healthify.nz/assets/Infographics/anaphylaxis-ASCIA-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.jpg) (external link)(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/hp/anaphylaxis/positioning \"Open external link\")\n(Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy)\nIf you have had anaphylaxis for the first time, after those immediate steps and then getting emergency medical care, as part of your treatment plan you need to:\n  * see a specialist to find out your triggers \n  * work out an[anaphylaxis action plan(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_EpiPen_2025.pdf \"Open external link\")\n  * attend follow-ups if required by your healthcare provider\n  * get educated on how to avoid triggers and use an adrenaline auto-injector if you are prescribed one\n  * ask your doctor or nurse specialist for an asthma management plan if you or your child also has asthma. \n\n\nThe Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) provides[free online training on anaphylaxis for patients, families and the community.(external link)(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/anaphylaxis-e-training-schools-and-childcare \"Open external link\")\n####    \nAdrenaline is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis\nAdrenaline is the treatment for anaphylaxis. Adrenaline works by quickly reversing the effects of anaphylaxis.\nAdrenaline can be easily given using an auto-injector such as an EpiPen (the only one available in Aotearoa New Zealand). The auto-injector injects a single, pre-measured dose of adrenaline into your muscle. If you're at risk of anaphylaxis, then your healthcare provider might ask you to carry an auto-injector with you. Deaths from anaphylaxis are more common away from home and when adrenaline is either not used or is delayed.\nIf you or your child are prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector, it is important to learn and practise how to use it. You can register your EpiPen with [My EpiPen(external link)](https://www.myepipen.co.nz \"Open external link\")\n####    \nDon't use antihistamines\nDon’t use antihistamines to treat anaphylaxis – giving adrenaline quickly is the only treatment for anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life threatening, severe allergic reaction and should always be treated as a medical emergency.  \n  \n\n####  How can I prevent anaphylaxis? \nOnce you have had an anaphylactic reaction you will be referred to a specialist to help you work out your triggers. This may involve allergy testing or food/drug challenge.\nKnowing your triggers for anaphylaxis is essential. In many cases avoidance is the only way to prevent anaphylaxis. Your specialist will help you work out ways to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis. This usually includes writing up an emergency anaphylaxis action plan. You will need to have regular reassessment, to check if the allergy is still present and to make sure your prevention plan is working for you.\nCarrying your adrenaline auto-injector with you at all times if you have one and using it if you think you may have anaphylaxis can also help to prevent your anaphylaxis from getting worse.\n####  What support is available with anaphylaxis? \nIt can be frightening if you have anaphylaxis. Talk through your feelings with your family/whānau members or health professionals taking care of you. Read more about how to talk about your feelings. \nBelow are some support services and information for people affected by anaphylaxis and their family/whānau:\n[Allergy NZ(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")Check their website or phone 0800 34 0800 for information and support.   \n[EpiPen(external link)](https://www.myepipen.co.nz/ \"Open external link\") Online educational resource where you can access additional information about anaphylaxis and EpiPen®.\n####  Be prepared with an anaphylaxis action plan \nAn action plan for anaphylaxis provides a course of action to follow in the event of an allergic reaction, which is often due to food allergy or insect stings. Susceptible people and their families should be able to recognise the symptoms of anaphylaxis and know in advance what to do in an emergency.  \n  \nA copy of your Anaphylaxis Action Plan, filled in and signed by your doctor or nurse specialist, should be kept with your EpiPen and taken with you wherever you go. A copy should be given to your child’s early childhood centre or school, or kept at your workplace.  \n  \nAnaphylaxis action plans are produced by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) and are updated regularly. Your doctor or nurse specialist should review these regularly with you. Go through these action plans with your healthcare providers and ask any questions if you are unsure.​\n#### Action plan for EpiPen\n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_EpiPen_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for EpiPen general use\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_EpiPen_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or to be stored with general use EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### General anaphylaxis action plan \n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_General_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed any brand of adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for general anaphylaxis\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or stored with general use adrenaline auto-injectors.   \n\n#### Action plan for allergic reactions\n[ASCIA action plan for allergic reactions (green) 2025(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who haven't been prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors. \n####   \nFirst aid treatment for anaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction and potentially life threatening.

Read more about how to talk about your feelings. \nBelow are some support services and information for people affected by anaphylaxis and their family/whānau:\n[Allergy NZ(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")Check their website or phone 0800 34 0800 for information and support.   \n[EpiPen(external link)](https://www.myepipen.co.nz/ \"Open external link\") Online educational resource where you can access additional information about anaphylaxis and EpiPen®.\n####  Be prepared with an anaphylaxis action plan \nAn action plan for anaphylaxis provides a course of action to follow in the event of an allergic reaction, which is often due to food allergy or insect stings. Susceptible people and their families should be able to recognise the symptoms of anaphylaxis and know in advance what to do in an emergency.  \n  \nA copy of your Anaphylaxis Action Plan, filled in and signed by your doctor or nurse specialist, should be kept with your EpiPen and taken with you wherever you go. A copy should be given to your child’s early childhood centre or school, or kept at your workplace.  \n  \nAnaphylaxis action plans are produced by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) and are updated regularly. Your doctor or nurse specialist should review these regularly with you. Go through these action plans with your healthcare providers and ask any questions if you are unsure.​\n#### Action plan for EpiPen\n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_EpiPen_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for EpiPen general use\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_EpiPen_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or to be stored with general use EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### General anaphylaxis action plan \n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_General_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed any brand of adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for general anaphylaxis\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or stored with general use adrenaline auto-injectors.   \n\n#### Action plan for allergic reactions\n[ASCIA action plan for allergic reactions (green) 2025(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who haven't been prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors. \n####   \nFirst aid treatment for anaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction and potentially life threatening.
