It was created as part of the UK Amazing Things Project. The video is available in a range of languages at [Amazingthingshappen.tv(external link)](https://amazingthingshappen.tv/?projects=amazing-things-happen \"Open external link\"). \nThis video may take a few moments to load.  \n  \n\n(Amazing Things Project, UK, 2017)\n####  What is autism? \nAutism is a difference in development that affects:\n  * communication (verbal and nonverbal)\n  * social skills\n  * behaviour.\n\n\n####    \nCommunication and social skills\nCommunication and social skills develop in children at different rates. Communication involves many different skills. Children learn to understand what people say to them. They learn to speak clearly and use words and sentences to talk and to get their message across. They learn to understand and use gestures, signs and body language. They learn to look, listen and take turns in a conversation.\nChildren with autism have differences in how they develop these skills. It may take them longer. The way they communicate and interact with others might always be different. For example, some children with autism might take longer to learn to speak. Some may not speak at all. Others may learn to speak at the expected time.\n_**\"It is common for me and other people with autism to be unable to say the words to describe what is bothering us. It's also hard for us to figure out that other people don't experience the world the same way we do\".**_\n####    \nBehaviour\nChildren with autism often have differences in the way they behave. They can sometimes enjoy a narrow range of interests which they like to repeat and they may also like to play with toys differently than other children. Children with autism can sometimes make unusual movements with their body. They may have more difficulty with change than other children.\nThe way that children with autism experience their environment through their senses is different. They might find common sensations either calming and pleasant, or annoying and even painful. For example, they might find some loud sounds distressing. They might also find some body movements calming, eg, rocking or spinning.   \n  \n\n![Boy with his hands on aquarium tank watching fish swimming](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Children/Boy-gazing-at-fishes-in-aquarium-Deposit-photos__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\n_Image credit: Depositphotos_\n####    \nChildren with autism interpret the world differently\nChildren with autism interpret the world and what's happening around them differently than other children.\n####    \nAutism is different for every child who has it\nWhen people talk about autism spectrum, they're referring to the wide range of differences in children with autism. These differences can vary with age and can also vary over time in a child.\nRather than thinking about your child with autism as sitting somewhere on a line, imagine each of their skills in a circle. Your child will have strengths in some areas and challenges in others.\n####  What are the names for autism? \nTakiwātanga means in his, her or my own time and space. It comes from a Māori phrase for autism – “tōku/tōna anō takiwā”.\nThere's no single way of describing autism that everyone agrees on. People may refer to autism, autism spectrum, the spectrum and ASD. People with autism often prefer to identify as autistic, an autistic person, a person with autism or as an autistic individual. In the health system, it's often called autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n####  What are the signs of possible autism in a young child (under 3 years of age)? \nA young child with autism might have some or all of the following challenges.\n#### Relating to others and playing\nA young child may:\n  * prefer to play or be alone\n  * not smile when smiled at\n  * have difficulty with eye contact\n  * not recognise or respond to another person's happiness or distress\n  * not want to be picked up or cuddled\n  * seem disinterested in, or too friendly with, other people\n  * appear to be in their own world\n  * prefer to play alone\n  * not copy others (clapping, waving)\n  * ignore greetings and farewells (such as waving hello or goodbye)\n  * not respond when you play peek-a-boo or other games\n  * not do much pretend play or 'make believe' (talking on the phone or looking after a doll)\n  * not involve other people in what they're doing (such as not bringing toys or objects to share)\n  * not invite other people to look at what they're doing.\n\n\n####    \nCommunicating\nA young child might:\n  * find it hard to communicate what they want\n  * have talking or listening skills that are behind other children of their age\n  * appear to not understand what people want or say\n  * use language in an unusual way (such as repeating words or songs)\n  * not respond to their name\n  * refer to themselves as 'you' or 'she/he' rather than 'I'\n  * not point to things or not show interest when others point to things\n  * sometimes appear not to hear\n  * lead someone by the hand to show what they want\n  * may not seek help when they need it\n  * have difficulty following directions.\n\n\n####    \nDifferences in interests and behaviours\nA young child may:\n  * have a narrow range of interests\n  * need things to be done in a particular way\n  * get very upset at changes in routine\n  * play with toys in a repetitive way (might line things up or put things in a certain order)\n  * seem to get stuck doing the same thing over and over\n  * make unusual movements with their body (eg, hand flapping or walking on toes)\n  * play with toys in unusual ways (eg, spinning the wheels on a car)\n  * not like make-believe play (such as pretending to make or do things)\n  * like to hold and keep unusual objects (eg, a key ring or piece of string)\n  * not like loud noises (may put hands over ears)\n  * really like or dislike certain sounds, smells, tastes or the way things look or feel\n  * either cope unusually well with pain or find even a little pain very difficult.\n\n\n####    \nWhat are the definite signs that my young child needs assessment for autism?\n  * No babbling or pointing or other gesture by 12 months of age.\n  * No single words by 16 months.\n  * No 2-word phrases by 24 months.\n  * Any loss of any language or social skills at any age.\n\n\n####  What are the signs of possible autism in a child (4 to 8 years of age)? \nYou may have noticed some of the signs described for a young child.

Older children and teens with autism have difficulty thinking in an abstract way. They often develop a growing awareness of their social difficulties as relationships become more complex. Without the right support and understanding, they may be bullied or develop anxiety or depression, particularly at times of stress or change (eg, exams or leaving school).\n####  How is autism diagnosed? \n  * You may be one of the first to notice signs of autism in your child\n  * Your child's teachers, Well Child nurse or healthcare provider may also raise concerns about your child's development\n  * If you're worried and you haven't seen your healthcare provider, make an appointment to talk to them – it really helps to give them as much information as possible.\n  * If your child needs an assessment for autism-takiwātanga, your healthcare provider can arrange this.\n  * It can take many months to get an assessment – waiting times vary across Aotearoa New Zealand.\n  * There are some things you can do in the meantime.\n\n\nRead more on KidsHealth about [autism diagnosis(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/autism-takiw%C4%81tanga-diagnosis \"Open external link\").\n####  Support following a diagnosis of autism (+ APPS) \nParents and whānau can have a range of responses to a diagnosis of autism in their child.

There's not much information about how common autism is in Aotearoa New Zealand.\nAutism is more common in boys than girls. But this may be partly because not all girls with autism have been diagnosed.\nIt might seem like there are more children with autism now than in the past. This is probably because of better recognition than in the past. It could also be because of changes in autism diagnosis.\nAutism occurs in children and adults – it's usually diagnosed in childhood. Sometimes a diagnosis isn't made until the teenage years or adulthood when social demands exceed a person's abilities.\n####  What causes autism and how common is it? \n#### Causes\nWe don't know exactly what causes autism but it's likely to be a combination of factors. Children with autism are more likely to have a similarly affected family member. This suggests genetic factors play a part.\nSome children will have a rare medical condition that may be associated with autism.\nExtensive research shows that the[measles, mumps and rubella](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/measles-mumps-and-rubella-mmr-vaccine)\n####    \nHow common is it?\nOverseas figures vary from about 1 in 59 to 1 in 100.
