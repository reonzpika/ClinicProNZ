It's most common in children under 5 years of age.\n  * Most food allergies are due to a small number of foods such as egg or milk but almost any food can cause a reaction.\n  * Mild to moderate allergic reactions include swelling of the face, lips or eyes, skin hives/welts, mouth tingling, stomach pain or vomiting.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction with noisy breathing, swelling of tongue or throat, wheeze or persistent cough, difficulty talking or hoarse voice, dizziness or collapse. Young children may be pale and floppy.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency – call 111 for an ambulance and give adrenaline (epinephrine) if it's available. \n\n\n![Boy with allergy saying no to peanuts being offered](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Food-and-drink/Child-saying-no-to-peanuts-allergy-canva-950x690.jpg)\n![](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies)\n####  What is a food allergy? \nA food allergy is caused by your immune system overreacting to certain types of protein in your food. Most allergic reactions to food are due to a small number of foods (see the [list of foods most likely to cause an allergy](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#common-allergenic-foods) below).\nWhen you have a food allergy, your body triggers an allergic reaction every time you eat or drink anything that contains the allergen. Even a very tiny amount can cause a reaction.\nReactions usually happen quickly – often within minutes, and almost always within a couple of hours. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from mild to severe, including [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis). You can find [a list of signs and symptoms](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#food-allergy-symptoms) below.\n####  Food intolerance \nFood allergy and food intolerance are commonly confused as the symptoms can be similar. A food intolerance is an unpleasant reaction to a food, but it doesn't involve your immune system. \nFood intolerances can have various causes. Symptoms, such as bloating, headaches and tummy pain, may happen within hours to days after a food is eaten. A food intolerance is not life-threatening and doesn't include immediate, severe reactions such as [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis).\nThere are lots of expensive intolerance tests available (eg, hair test) but none of these are valid and should be avoided. Read more about the difference between [food allergy and intolerance](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance).\n####  Who is affected by food allergy? \nA food allergy can develop at any age, but it's most common in tamariki under 5 years of age. About 1 in 10 infants have a food allergy by 12 months of age. Read more about [reducing food allergies in infants](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/r/reducing-food-allergies-in-infants).\nSome people will grow out of their food allergies (mainly allergies to milk or eggs) – it's estimated that 6–8% of school age children and 2–4% of adults have a food allergy. \nYou have a slightly higher chance of getting a food allergy if you or a close family member have any [allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies), [asthma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults) or [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema).\nDeveloping a food allergy as an adult isn't common. Food intolerance is much more common in adults and can have a variety of causes. Read more about the difference between [food allergy and intolerance](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance).\n####    \nDo food allergies last for life?\nMost children who are allergic to cow's milk, soy, wheat or egg will ‘outgrow’ their food allergy. About 80% of children eventually tolerate these foods by 5 years of age.\nHowever, peanut, tree nut, seed and seafood allergies tend to be lifelong allergies.\n####  What are the common allergy-causing foods? \nAlthough almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, the main foods causing food allergy in Aotearoa New Zealand are:\n  * dairy (cow's milk)\n  * eggs\n  * fish\n  * peanuts\n  * sesame\n  * shellfish (crustacea and molluscs)\n  * soy\n  * tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, walnuts)\n  * wheat\n  * kiwifruit.\n\n\nYou should always see a paediatric or allergy dietitian before removing any food groups (eg, dairy or wheat) from your, or your child's, diet unless there has been an immediate reaction to the food. Any avoidance of foods needs to happen with medical and dietitian supervision to make sure there's adequate nutrition for growth and development.  \n  \n\n![Foods most likely to cause allergies](https://healthify.nz/assets/Infographics/Foods-most-likely-to-cause-allergies-HN-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.png)\n_Image credit: Healthify He Puna Waiora_\n####  What are the symptoms of food allergy? \nSymptoms, their severity and the time they take to develop may be different for each person, and from one episode to another.\nSymptoms usually occur within 5 to 30 minutes of exposure to an allergen. However, some reactions can occur up to 2 hours later.\nMost reactions will be mild to moderate but, in some cases, a food allergy can lead to life-threatening symptoms, known as anaphylaxis, [](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis)which is a medical emergency. Some people experience anaphylaxis without first developing mild or moderate symptoms. Read more about [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis).\n####    \nMild to moderate symptoms include:\n  * [hives/urticaria](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hives \"Hives\") (swollen, itchy, pink/red bumps) or welts on your skin\n  * swelling of your lips, face or eyes\n  * abdominal or tummy pain\n  * vomiting (being sick).\n\n\n####    \nSigns of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) include:\n  * swelling of your tongue\n  * swelling or tightness in your throat\n  * difficulty breathing or noisy breathing (wheezing)\n  * difficulty talking or a hoarse voice\n  * dizziness, loss of consciousness or collapse\n  * being pale and floppy (in young children).  \n  \n\n\n**Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, requiring urgent medical attention and treatment. If you or someone you care for experiences the above symptoms of anaphylaxis, give adrenaline if available and call 111 for an ambulance.**  \n---  \n####    \nOther reactions to food\nOther reactions to foods can occur and are often mistaken for food allergy. These include [food intolerances](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance), toxic reactions, food poisoning, enzyme deficiencies, food aversion or irritation from skin contact with certain foods.\n####  How is food allergy diagnosed? \nIf an infant or young child has had a severe reaction, they should be treated in an emergency department. On discharge, the doctor will refer the infant or child back to their healthcare provider for follow up. This may include arranging tests and a referral to the paediatric service at your local hospital.\nYour doctor or nurse practitioner should also provide parents/carers with a signed **ASCIA Allergy (green)** or **Anaphylaxis (red) Action Plan** and if a particular allergen (or food) is suspected to have caused the reaction, they should give advice about how to avoid it.\nIf you think you or your child has a food allergy, the first step is to see your healthcare provider. It's important to get a reliable diagnosis of food allergy before restricting a particular food in your or your child’s diet as this can affect their growth and development.\nAn experienced GP, nurse practitioner, paediatrician or allergy dietitian will take a history of reactions, do an examination and possibly arrange for allergy tests.\nA diagnosis will be based on clinical history, such as:\n  * the food eaten\n  * whether this has previously been tolerated\n  * what sort of symptoms (eg, a rash or sore tummy) have happened, and\n  * how long after the food was eaten the symptoms developed.\n\n\nIf necessary, your healthcare provider may refer you for skin prick testing or order blood tests for allergen specific Immunoglobulin E (antibodies) to help to identify or exclude potential food allergy triggers. Sometimes a medically supervised food allergen challenge is done to confirm or exclude food allergy.\n####  How is food allergy treated? \nCurrently, there's no cure for food allergy – avoiding the food is the only way to prevent a reaction. This can be challenging, especially when some foods may contain small amounts of the allergen. Your doctor, nurse or allergy dietitian can provide advice about avoiding food allergens.  \n  \nAdrenaline is used to treat severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). It can be administered with an auto-injector such as an [EpiPen(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.au/health-professionals/anaphylaxis-resources/how-to-give-epipen \"Open external link\") to slow down or stop a severe allergic reaction. If you have a food allergy and are thought to be at higher risk of developing anaphylaxis, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse can teach you how to inject adrenaline using an EpiPen. You will also need to have an anaphylaxis action plan that documents what to do if you have anaphylaxis and when to call for help. Read more about [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\").\nIf you have a mild or moderate allergic reaction, treatment aims to relieve your symptoms. Antihistamines are the most commonly used medicines. Antihistamines relieve itching or hives on your skin and may need to be taken for a few weeks to reduce the build-up of histamine in the body. Examples include cetirizine and loratadine. You will also need to have an action plan that outlines what to do when you have an allergic reaction. Read more about [antihistamines](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/antihistamines).\n####    \nGradual introduction of cooked allergenic foods\nResearchers continue to explore new ways of more effectively treating food allergies. Treatment of milk and egg allergies now includes recommendations on introducing milk and egg in baked products, following a ‘ladder’, until the raw version of the food can be eaten safely. This has been shown to promote earlier tolerance. The allergen containing food (eg, milk or egg) is reintroduced in a stepwise approach. However, it's important that any reintroduction of foods is always led by a specialist or allergy dietitian. \n####    \nOral immunotherapy\nOral immunotherapy treatment (OIT) is a potential treatment for food allergy. It involves giving tiny and increasing amounts of the food protein to ‘desensitise’ the immune system to that food. Results from preliminary research into immunotherapy look promising. However, more research is needed to understand the safety, benefits, cost-effectiveness, impact on quality of life and long-term outcomes. This kind of treatment should only be provided under the supervision of a clinical immunology or allergy specialist. Read more about [oral immunotherapy treatment(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/allergy-treatments/oral-immunotherapy-for-food-allergy \"Open external link\").\n####  How can I prevent allergic reactions? \nTo prevent the symptoms of food allergy you need to completely avoid the allergen. After you have identified the allergen/s you (or your child) react to, you must remove them from your (or your child’s) diet.\nHere are some of the ways to minimise the risk of being exposed to a particular food allergen:\n  * Tell others, such as restaurant staff, about the food allergy when eating away from home.\n  * Don't share or swap food or utensils with others.\n  * Ask about food ingredients when offered food by others.\n  * Be aware of cross-contamination of food allergens when preparing food.\n  * Wash hands and surfaces to prevent cross-contamination.\n  * Know how to identify your food allergen and check food product labels – see the section below.\n  * Have a travel plan for any trips away from home – read more about [travelling with food allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies-travel).\n  * If the allergy is to egg, know which vaccines to avoid, eg, the yellow fever vaccine, Q fever vaccine and the Rabipur brand of rabies vaccine. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can provide advice and more details about these vaccines.\n\n\n####  Reading and checking food labels (+ VIDEO link) \nThe Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires common food allergens to be declared on a food label if the allergen is contained in the food as an ingredient, part of an ingredient, a food additive or a processing aid. Allergen information must be declared in a specific format which is known as Plain English Allergen Labelling (PEAL).\nThe PEAL regulations require:\n  * The same consistent names to be used for the common food allergens which include egg, fish, lupin, milk, mollusc, crustacea, peanut, sesame, soy, wheat, gluten and all the individual tree nuts (cashew, almond, Brazil nut etc).\n  * A ‘summary statement’, beginning with the word ‘contains’, that lists the allergens in the food.\n  * The summary statement must be located next to the ingredient list – it can be above, below or on either side of it.\n\n\nFor more information see the [Food Standards(external link)](https://www.foodstandards.govt.nz/consumer/labelling/allergen-labelling \"Open external link\") Australia New Zealand website or [Allergy New Zealand food allergen labelling(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.nz/managing-allergies/managing-food-allergy/allergen-labelling/ \"Open external link\").\n####    \nVideos\nYou can watch 2 videos about reading food labels for food allergens on this [Food Allergy Aware webpage(external link)](https://foodallergyaware.org.au/everyone/reading-food-labels-for-food-allergens \"Open external link\").\n####  How can I care for myself with food allergy? \nDespite your best efforts to avoid particular foods, you may be exposed to a food allergen accidentally.\nBe prepared for this:\n  * Have an [allergy action plan(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/hp/anaphylaxis/ascia-action-plan-for-anaphylaxis \"Open external link\") (see below).\n  * Carry your adrenaline autoinjector with you at all times if you're at risk of anaphylaxis.\n  * Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace so medical staff know what to do in a medical emergency.\n  * Learn [the signs and symptoms of mild to moderate and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#food-allergy-symptoms) and know what to do when a reaction occurs.\n\n\n####    \nAllergy action plans\nAn action plan documents and outlines the steps to follow if you have an allergic reaction, whether it's mild or serious. If you are thought to be at risk of anaphylaxis and have been prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector you need an [action plan for anaphylaxis.(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2023/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_Green_2023.pdf \"Open external link\") If you're not thought to be at high risk of anaphylaxis and haven't been prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector, you need an [action plan for allergic reactions.(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2023/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_Green_2023.pdf \"Open external link\")\nYour healthcare provider can discuss these plans with you and you can complete them together.

From there you can look for new recipes that use safe ingredients (see the recipes in the more information section).\n  * Educate family, friends and others who will be with your child about your child's allergies.\n  * Be sure to tell your child's school and anyone responsible for your child about their food allergies. Read more [allergy tips for children starting school](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies-tips-for-children-starting-school).\n  * For children with [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema), limiting their diet to try and reduce eczema doesn't work and can lead to poor nutrition. It can also increase the chance of them developing food allergies. Regular use of [steroid creams](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/steroid-creams-and-ointments) and moisturisers are the best way to manage eczema.\n\n\n####    \nHow you can teach your child to manage their food allergies\nTeach them to:\n  * **Identify allergens:** Help your child recognize the foods that trigger their allergies. Use simple, clear language and pictures (if needed) to reinforce which foods are safe and which are not.\n  * **Know where allergens are likely found:** Educate your child about common foods that may contain their allergen, such as certain nuts, dairy, eggs, gluten, or shellfish. Talk about hidden sources of allergens in processed foods, sauces, or snacks.\n  * **Not to share food and drinks:** Encourage your child to never share food or drinks with others, especially in environments such as school, parties, or social gatherings. Sharing food can unknowingly lead to cross-contamination.\n  * **Ask questions:** Teach your child to always ask an adult (or a trusted teacher or caregiver) whether a food contains their allergen before eating it. Emphasise the importance of being cautious, even if the food looks safe.\n  * **Avoid eating foods they're not sure about:** Remind your child that if they're ever uncertain whether a food contains their allergen, it's safest to avoid it and ask an adult for clarification.\n  * **Handle situations at parties, school, or camp:** Prepare your child for social settings where food may be shared. Provide them with safe snacks to bring along and let them know it's okay to politely refuse food from others. Teach them how to explain their allergy to friends or caregivers and encourage them to speak up if they feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nBy teaching your child these skills, you'll help empower them to make safe choices and build confidence in managing their allergies independently.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\")

It's most common in children under 5 years of age.\n  * Most food allergies are due to a small number of foods such as egg or milk but almost any food can cause a reaction.\n  * Mild to moderate allergic reactions include swelling of the face, lips or eyes, skin hives/welts, mouth tingling, stomach pain or vomiting.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction with noisy breathing, swelling of tongue or throat, wheeze or persistent cough, difficulty talking or hoarse voice, dizziness or collapse. Young children may be pale and floppy.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency – call 111 for an ambulance and give adrenaline (epinephrine) if it's available. \n\n\n![Boy with allergy saying no to peanuts being offered](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Food-and-drink/Child-saying-no-to-peanuts-allergy-canva-950x690.jpg)\n![](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies)\n####  What is a food allergy? \nA food allergy is caused by your immune system overreacting to certain types of protein in your food. Most allergic reactions to food are due to a small number of foods (see the [list of foods most likely to cause an allergy](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#common-allergenic-foods) below).\nWhen you have a food allergy, your body triggers an allergic reaction every time you eat or drink anything that contains the allergen. Even a very tiny amount can cause a reaction.\nReactions usually happen quickly – often within minutes, and almost always within a couple of hours. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from mild to severe, including [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis). You can find [a list of signs and symptoms](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#food-allergy-symptoms) below.\n####  Food intolerance \nFood allergy and food intolerance are commonly confused as the symptoms can be similar. A food intolerance is an unpleasant reaction to a food, but it doesn't involve your immune system. \nFood intolerances can have various causes. Symptoms, such as bloating, headaches and tummy pain, may happen within hours to days after a food is eaten. A food intolerance is not life-threatening and doesn't include immediate, severe reactions such as [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis).\nThere are lots of expensive intolerance tests available (eg, hair test) but none of these are valid and should be avoided. Read more about the difference between [food allergy and intolerance](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance).\n####  Who is affected by food allergy? \nA food allergy can develop at any age, but it's most common in tamariki under 5 years of age. About 1 in 10 infants have a food allergy by 12 months of age. Read more about [reducing food allergies in infants](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/r/reducing-food-allergies-in-infants).\nSome people will grow out of their food allergies (mainly allergies to milk or eggs) – it's estimated that 6–8% of school age children and 2–4% of adults have a food allergy. \nYou have a slightly higher chance of getting a food allergy if you or a close family member have any [allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies), [asthma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults) or [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema).\nDeveloping a food allergy as an adult isn't common. Food intolerance is much more common in adults and can have a variety of causes. Read more about the difference between [food allergy and intolerance](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance).\n####    \nDo food allergies last for life?\nMost children who are allergic to cow's milk, soy, wheat or egg will ‘outgrow’ their food allergy. About 80% of children eventually tolerate these foods by 5 years of age.\nHowever, peanut, tree nut, seed and seafood allergies tend to be lifelong allergies.\n####  What are the common allergy-causing foods? \nAlthough almost any food can cause an allergic reaction, the main foods causing food allergy in Aotearoa New Zealand are:\n  * dairy (cow's milk)\n  * eggs\n  * fish\n  * peanuts\n  * sesame\n  * shellfish (crustacea and molluscs)\n  * soy\n  * tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, walnuts)\n  * wheat\n  * kiwifruit.\n\n\nYou should always see a paediatric or allergy dietitian before removing any food groups (eg, dairy or wheat) from your, or your child's, diet unless there has been an immediate reaction to the food. Any avoidance of foods needs to happen with medical and dietitian supervision to make sure there's adequate nutrition for growth and development.  \n  \n\n![Foods most likely to cause allergies](https://healthify.nz/assets/Infographics/Foods-most-likely-to-cause-allergies-HN-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.png)\n_Image credit: Healthify He Puna Waiora_\n####  What are the symptoms of food allergy? \nSymptoms, their severity and the time they take to develop may be different for each person, and from one episode to another.\nSymptoms usually occur within 5 to 30 minutes of exposure to an allergen. However, some reactions can occur up to 2 hours later.\nMost reactions will be mild to moderate but, in some cases, a food allergy can lead to life-threatening symptoms, known as anaphylaxis, [](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis)which is a medical emergency. Some people experience anaphylaxis without first developing mild or moderate symptoms. Read more about [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis).\n####    \nMild to moderate symptoms include:\n  * [hives/urticaria](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hives \"Hives\") (swollen, itchy, pink/red bumps) or welts on your skin\n  * swelling of your lips, face or eyes\n  * abdominal or tummy pain\n  * vomiting (being sick).\n\n\n####    \nSigns of a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) include:\n  * swelling of your tongue\n  * swelling or tightness in your throat\n  * difficulty breathing or noisy breathing (wheezing)\n  * difficulty talking or a hoarse voice\n  * dizziness, loss of consciousness or collapse\n  * being pale and floppy (in young children).  \n  \n\n\n**Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, requiring urgent medical attention and treatment. If you or someone you care for experiences the above symptoms of anaphylaxis, give adrenaline if available and call 111 for an ambulance.**  \n---  \n####    \nOther reactions to food\nOther reactions to foods can occur and are often mistaken for food allergy. These include [food intolerances](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergy-or-intolerance), toxic reactions, food poisoning, enzyme deficiencies, food aversion or irritation from skin contact with certain foods.\n####  How is food allergy diagnosed? \nIf an infant or young child has had a severe reaction, they should be treated in an emergency department. On discharge, the doctor will refer the infant or child back to their healthcare provider for follow up. This may include arranging tests and a referral to the paediatric service at your local hospital.\nYour doctor or nurse practitioner should also provide parents/carers with a signed **ASCIA Allergy (green)** or **Anaphylaxis (red) Action Plan** and if a particular allergen (or food) is suspected to have caused the reaction, they should give advice about how to avoid it.\nIf you think you or your child has a food allergy, the first step is to see your healthcare provider. It's important to get a reliable diagnosis of food allergy before restricting a particular food in your or your child’s diet as this can affect their growth and development.\nAn experienced GP, nurse practitioner, paediatrician or allergy dietitian will take a history of reactions, do an examination and possibly arrange for allergy tests.\nA diagnosis will be based on clinical history, such as:\n  * the food eaten\n  * whether this has previously been tolerated\n  * what sort of symptoms (eg, a rash or sore tummy) have happened, and\n  * how long after the food was eaten the symptoms developed.\n\n\nIf necessary, your healthcare provider may refer you for skin prick testing or order blood tests for allergen specific Immunoglobulin E (antibodies) to help to identify or exclude potential food allergy triggers. Sometimes a medically supervised food allergen challenge is done to confirm or exclude food allergy.\n####  How is food allergy treated? \nCurrently, there's no cure for food allergy – avoiding the food is the only way to prevent a reaction. This can be challenging, especially when some foods may contain small amounts of the allergen. Your doctor, nurse or allergy dietitian can provide advice about avoiding food allergens.  \n  \nAdrenaline is used to treat severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis). It can be administered with an auto-injector such as an [EpiPen(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.au/health-professionals/anaphylaxis-resources/how-to-give-epipen \"Open external link\") to slow down or stop a severe allergic reaction. If you have a food allergy and are thought to be at higher risk of developing anaphylaxis, your doctor, pharmacist or nurse can teach you how to inject adrenaline using an EpiPen. You will also need to have an anaphylaxis action plan that documents what to do if you have anaphylaxis and when to call for help. Read more about [anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\").\nIf you have a mild or moderate allergic reaction, treatment aims to relieve your symptoms. Antihistamines are the most commonly used medicines. Antihistamines relieve itching or hives on your skin and may need to be taken for a few weeks to reduce the build-up of histamine in the body. Examples include cetirizine and loratadine. You will also need to have an action plan that outlines what to do when you have an allergic reaction. Read more about [antihistamines](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/antihistamines).\n####    \nGradual introduction of cooked allergenic foods\nResearchers continue to explore new ways of more effectively treating food allergies. Treatment of milk and egg allergies now includes recommendations on introducing milk and egg in baked products, following a ‘ladder’, until the raw version of the food can be eaten safely. This has been shown to promote earlier tolerance. The allergen containing food (eg, milk or egg) is reintroduced in a stepwise approach. However, it's important that any reintroduction of foods is always led by a specialist or allergy dietitian. \n####    \nOral immunotherapy\nOral immunotherapy treatment (OIT) is a potential treatment for food allergy. It involves giving tiny and increasing amounts of the food protein to ‘desensitise’ the immune system to that food. Results from preliminary research into immunotherapy look promising. However, more research is needed to understand the safety, benefits, cost-effectiveness, impact on quality of life and long-term outcomes. This kind of treatment should only be provided under the supervision of a clinical immunology or allergy specialist. Read more about [oral immunotherapy treatment(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/allergy-treatments/oral-immunotherapy-for-food-allergy \"Open external link\").\n####  How can I prevent allergic reactions? \nTo prevent the symptoms of food allergy you need to completely avoid the allergen. After you have identified the allergen/s you (or your child) react to, you must remove them from your (or your child’s) diet.\nHere are some of the ways to minimise the risk of being exposed to a particular food allergen:\n  * Tell others, such as restaurant staff, about the food allergy when eating away from home.\n  * Don't share or swap food or utensils with others.\n  * Ask about food ingredients when offered food by others.\n  * Be aware of cross-contamination of food allergens when preparing food.\n  * Wash hands and surfaces to prevent cross-contamination.\n  * Know how to identify your food allergen and check food product labels – see the section below.\n  * Have a travel plan for any trips away from home – read more about [travelling with food allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies-travel).\n  * If the allergy is to egg, know which vaccines to avoid, eg, the yellow fever vaccine, Q fever vaccine and the Rabipur brand of rabies vaccine. Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist can provide advice and more details about these vaccines.\n\n\n####  Reading and checking food labels (+ VIDEO link) \nThe Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires common food allergens to be declared on a food label if the allergen is contained in the food as an ingredient, part of an ingredient, a food additive or a processing aid. Allergen information must be declared in a specific format which is known as Plain English Allergen Labelling (PEAL).\nThe PEAL regulations require:\n  * The same consistent names to be used for the common food allergens which include egg, fish, lupin, milk, mollusc, crustacea, peanut, sesame, soy, wheat, gluten and all the individual tree nuts (cashew, almond, Brazil nut etc).\n  * A ‘summary statement’, beginning with the word ‘contains’, that lists the allergens in the food.\n  * The summary statement must be located next to the ingredient list – it can be above, below or on either side of it.\n\n\nFor more information see the [Food Standards(external link)](https://www.foodstandards.govt.nz/consumer/labelling/allergen-labelling \"Open external link\") Australia New Zealand website or [Allergy New Zealand food allergen labelling(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.nz/managing-allergies/managing-food-allergy/allergen-labelling/ \"Open external link\").\n####    \nVideos\nYou can watch 2 videos about reading food labels for food allergens on this [Food Allergy Aware webpage(external link)](https://foodallergyaware.org.au/everyone/reading-food-labels-for-food-allergens \"Open external link\").\n####  How can I care for myself with food allergy? \nDespite your best efforts to avoid particular foods, you may be exposed to a food allergen accidentally.\nBe prepared for this:\n  * Have an [allergy action plan(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/hp/anaphylaxis/ascia-action-plan-for-anaphylaxis \"Open external link\") (see below).\n  * Carry your adrenaline autoinjector with you at all times if you're at risk of anaphylaxis.\n  * Wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace so medical staff know what to do in a medical emergency.\n  * Learn [the signs and symptoms of mild to moderate and severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/food-allergies#food-allergy-symptoms) and know what to do when a reaction occurs.\n\n\n####    \nAllergy action plans\nAn action plan documents and outlines the steps to follow if you have an allergic reaction, whether it's mild or serious. If you are thought to be at risk of anaphylaxis and have been prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector you need an [action plan for anaphylaxis.(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2023/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_Green_2023.pdf \"Open external link\") If you're not thought to be at high risk of anaphylaxis and haven't been prescribed an adrenaline autoinjector, you need an [action plan for allergic reactions.(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2023/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_Green_2023.pdf \"Open external link\")\nYour healthcare provider can discuss these plans with you and you can complete them together.

From there you can look for new recipes that use safe ingredients (see the recipes in the more information section).\n  * Educate family, friends and others who will be with your child about your child's allergies.\n  * Be sure to tell your child's school and anyone responsible for your child about their food allergies. Read more [allergy tips for children starting school](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies-tips-for-children-starting-school).\n  * For children with [eczema](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eczema), limiting their diet to try and reduce eczema doesn't work and can lead to poor nutrition. It can also increase the chance of them developing food allergies. Regular use of [steroid creams](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/steroid-creams-and-ointments) and moisturisers are the best way to manage eczema.\n\n\n####    \nHow you can teach your child to manage their food allergies\nTeach them to:\n  * **Identify allergens:** Help your child recognize the foods that trigger their allergies. Use simple, clear language and pictures (if needed) to reinforce which foods are safe and which are not.\n  * **Know where allergens are likely found:** Educate your child about common foods that may contain their allergen, such as certain nuts, dairy, eggs, gluten, or shellfish. Talk about hidden sources of allergens in processed foods, sauces, or snacks.\n  * **Not to share food and drinks:** Encourage your child to never share food or drinks with others, especially in environments such as school, parties, or social gatherings. Sharing food can unknowingly lead to cross-contamination.\n  * **Ask questions:** Teach your child to always ask an adult (or a trusted teacher or caregiver) whether a food contains their allergen before eating it. Emphasise the importance of being cautious, even if the food looks safe.\n  * **Avoid eating foods they're not sure about:** Remind your child that if they're ever uncertain whether a food contains their allergen, it's safest to avoid it and ask an adult for clarification.\n  * **Handle situations at parties, school, or camp:** Prepare your child for social settings where food may be shared. Provide them with safe snacks to bring along and let them know it's okay to politely refuse food from others. Teach them how to explain their allergy to friends or caregivers and encourage them to speak up if they feel uncomfortable.\n\n\nBy teaching your child these skills, you'll help empower them to make safe choices and build confidence in managing their allergies independently.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Anaphylaxis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anaphylaxis \"Anaphylaxis\")
