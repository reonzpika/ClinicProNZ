It usually affects the 50-plus age group, and is slightly more common in women than men. It involves a change to the protective cushion of the cartilage covering the ends of your bones, where two bones meet to form a joint.\nRead more about[osteoarthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/o/osteoarthritis \"Osteoarthritis \\(OA\\)\").\n#### Rheumatoid arthritis\n[](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid Arthritis \")Rheumatoid arthritis can start at any age but usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 55. Three times as many women than men are affected. If not properly treated, ongoing inflammation can progressively damage your joints and cause joint deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, so it can also affect other systems in your body.\nRead more about[rheumatoid arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid arthritis\").\n#### Gout arthritis\nGout causes sudden attacks of pain in some joints. It can affect any joint but the first attack usually affects your big toe or another part of your foot. The joint becomes painful and swollen and the skin over the joint can become red and shiny. If not treated, gout can become chronic, causing damage to your joints and bones.\nRead more about[gout](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/g/gout \"Gout \").\n#### Other types of arthritis\nOther types of arthritis include:\n  * [knee arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/k/knee-arthritis \"Knee arthritis\")\n  * [ankylosing spondylitis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ankylosing-spondylitis \"Ankylosing spondylitis\")\n  * [juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/arthritis-children) (arthritis in children)\n  * [lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/l/lupus \"Lupus\")\n  * [polymyalgia rheumatica](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/polymyalgia-rheumatica-pmr \"Polymyalgia rheumatica \\(PMR\\)\")\n  * [psoriatic arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/psoriasis \"Psoriasis\")\n  * [reactive arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/reactive-arthritis \"Reactive arthritis\")\n  * [scleroderma](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/scleroderma \"Scleroderma\").\n\n\n####  Who is at risk of getting arthritis? \nWhile anyone can be affected by arthritis at any stage of life, there are 5 groups most at risk:\n  * **Overweight people**\n  * **Older people**\n  * **Sports people**\n  * **Women**\n  * **Mā****ori and Pasifika men** – Māori and Pasifika men in Aotearoa New Zealand have the highest rate of gout arthritis in the world.\n\n\nOther risk factors include:\n  * having a family history of arthritis\n  * if you have had a joint injury or joint infection\n  * having worked in heavy physical occupation.\n\n\n#### Arthritis in children\nChildren can develop arthritis too.[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/arthritis-children \"Arthritis in children\") (JIA) is a term used to describe arthritis in children. It has also been called juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Around 1 in 1000 children are affected by juvenile arthritis. It is commonly diagnosed between the ages of 1 and 4 years, but it can occur at any age.\n####  What are the symptoms of arthritis? \nYou may have arthritis if you have:\n  * swelling in one or more joints\n  * early morning stiffness for more than a few minutes\n  * recurring pain or tenderness in one or more joints\n  * reduced movement\n  * obvious redness or warmth in one or more joints\n  * unexplained weight loss, fever or weakness combined with joint pain.\n\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks, see your doctor.\n####  What is the treatment for arthritis? (+ APPS) \nTreatment depends on the type of arthritis and how severe it is. It's important to get a correct diagnosis before beginning any treatment. Generally, for most types of arthritis, the treatment includes:\n  * weight management\n  * exercise\n  * medicine\n  * rest\n  * joint protection\n  * in some cases surgery to correct or prevent deformity, increase mobility and improve quality of life.\n\n\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps) and [Exercise apps for older adults](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/exercise-apps-for-older-adults).\n####  What self-care can I do with arthritis? \nA range of self-care practices can help you manage and reduce the effects of arthritis.  \n  \nThese may include:\n  * diet\n  * medicine\n  * physical activity\n  * joint protection\n  * stress management\n  * hot/cold therapy\n  * weight management to prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints\n  * evidence-based complementary therapies.\n\n\n#### Self-care courses and programmes\nResearch has shown that people who exercise regularly, practice relaxation and/or use other self-care techniques have less pain and are more active than people who do not self-manage their condition. Courses are designed to give you the skills needed to take a more active part in your arthritis care, together with a healthcare team.\nVisit our[self-care programmes](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/programmes-courses \"Programmes & courses\") section to see if there is a course in your area.\n####  Support \n[Arthritis NZ(external link)(external link)](http://www.arthritis.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") Freephone 0800 663 463\nArthritis NZ employs skilled educators.
