It involves a change to the protective cushion of the cartilage covering the ends of your bones, where two bones meet to form a joint.\nRead more about[osteoarthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/o/osteoarthritis \"Osteoarthritis \\(OA\\)\").\n#### Rheumatoid arthritis\n[](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid Arthritis \")Rheumatoid arthritis can start at any age but usually occurs between the ages of 20 and 55. Three times as many women than men are affected. If not properly treated, ongoing inflammation can progressively damage your joints and cause joint deformities. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition, so it can also affect other systems in your body.\nRead more about[rheumatoid arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/r/rheumatoid-arthritis \"Rheumatoid arthritis\").\n#### Gout arthritis\nGout causes sudden attacks of pain in some joints. It can affect any joint but the first attack usually affects your big toe or another part of your foot. The joint becomes painful and swollen and the skin over the joint can become red and shiny.

It has also been called juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Around 1 in 1000 children are affected by juvenile arthritis. It is commonly diagnosed between the ages of 1 and 4 years, but it can occur at any age.\n####  What are the symptoms of arthritis? \nYou may have arthritis if you have:\n  * swelling in one or more joints\n  * early morning stiffness for more than a few minutes\n  * recurring pain or tenderness in one or more joints\n  * reduced movement\n  * obvious redness or warmth in one or more joints\n  * unexplained weight loss, fever or weakness combined with joint pain.\n\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks, see your doctor.\n####  What is the treatment for arthritis?
