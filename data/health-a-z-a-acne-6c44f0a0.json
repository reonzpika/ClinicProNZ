It isn't contagious and it often disappears when you're in your mid-20s.\n\n\n![Young man looking at facial acne in mirror](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Skin-topics/Young-man-looking-at-acne-in-mirror-canva-950x690.jpg)\nQR Code Print\nOpen all Close all\n####  Acne overview \n  * Acne (mate huahua) is a common skin condition causing spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that’s hot and painful to touch.\n  * Acne is commonly linked to hormonal changes during puberty, but it can start at any age and may continue into your 30s and 40s.\n  * Acne affects about 85% of people 12 to 24 years of age, but teenage boys and young men are more likely to have severe acne.\n  * Hormonal changes related to pregnancy, menopause, stopping/starting oral contraceptives (the pill) and some conditions (eg, [polycystic ovary syndrome](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/polycystic-ovary-syndrome)) can also cause acne in adult women.\n  * Acne usually appears on your face, neck, upper back or chest. Some people only have a few spots, while for others acne can be severe, emotionally distressing and lead to scarring.\n  * Mild acne may be improved with over-the-counter acne products and good skincare. See your pharmacist for advice.\n  * If you have persistent or severe acne, see your healthcare provider. There are prescription treatments that can help, and these may prevent scarring if started early.\n\n\n####  What causes acne? \nAcne involves the hair follicles and oil glands on your skin. In acne, the glands produce too much oil (sebum) which mixes with dead skin cells or bacteria to form a plug in the follicle.\nNormally harmless bacteria that live on your skin can contaminate and infect the blocked follicles, causing pimples, pustules, nodules or cysts.\n![Different stages of acne](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Skin-topics/Stages-of-acne-brgfx-freepix-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.jpg)\n_Image credit: brgfx on Freepik (amended)_\nAcne is usually caused by hormonal changes that occur during puberty, but it can start at any age.\n####    \nWhat else can cause acne?\n  * If you menstruate (have periods), or are undergoing menopause, you may notice your acne flares up just before your period, due to changes in sex hormones (eg, oestrogen).\n  * Hormonal changes related to pregnancy, stopping or starting oral contraceptives and conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome can also cause adult acne for some people.\n  * Acne can run in families. If your parents had problems with acne, it's more likely you will too.\n  * Acne can be made worse by some medicines, eg, steroids, lithium (used to treat depression and bipolar disorder), some forms of contraceptives (eg, Mini-Pill, Jadelle, Depo Provera), and some anti-epileptic medicines.\n  * Some cosmetic products might cause acne to flare up, although it’s less common with ‘non-comedogenic’ products – products designed so that so they don’t cause spots.\n  * Pressure from headbands and chinstraps (used by violin and viola players).\n  * Smoking might contribute to acne in older people.\n  * Diets with a high glycaemic index. Acne is reported to be less common in people with a lower glycaemic index diet.\n  * Eating a lot of dairy products, meat protein and sugars can make acne worse for some people.\n  * There's some evidence that stress and depression can make acne worse.\n\n\n####    \nWhat doesn't cause acne?\n  * While there’s not enough evidence about chocolate’s role in acne, eating too much of it can lead to weight gain – a known risk factor for acne.\n  * Acne is not infectious – you can’t pass it on to other people.\n  * Having sex or masturbating will not make acne better or worse.\n  * Having dirty skin and poor hygiene doesn’t cause acne – most of the biological reactions that trigger acne occur beneath your skin.\n\n\n####  How bad is my acne? \nYour healthcare provider can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. How bad (severe) it is, will determine what treatment you might have.\n  * Mild – mostly whiteheads and blackheads, with a few pustules.\n  * Moderate – more widespread whiteheads and blackheads, with many pustules and some cysts.\n  * Severe – lots of large, painful pustules and deep cysts; you might also have some scarring.\n\n\n####  How is acne treated? (+ APPS) \nEveryone wants to get rid of acne as quickly as possible, but it might take several months of treatment before your acne improves. However, with the right treatment, you should see results along the way.\n**Tip:** Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist first, to get professional advice. Using the wrong acne products or skincare range (or following the advice of a celebrity in an advertisement) might make your acne worse.\n  * For mild acne, over-the-counter creams, pimple patches or gels from your pharmacist might be a good place to start.\n  * Talk to your pharmacist about a simple, acne-friendly skincare range (eg, Cetaphil). For some people with mild acne, a cleanser with salicylic acid might be all you need.\n  * If using these products or getting help from your pharmacy doesn’t work, your healthcare provider might give you prescription medicine, eg: \n    * topical retinoids\n    * topical antibiotics\n    * antibiotic tablets (oral antibiotics)\n    * for women, the combined oral contraceptive pill\n    * Spironolactone\n    * [Isotretinoin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/i/isotretinoin)\n\n\nRead more about [medicines used to treat acne](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/acne-treatment).\nYour healthcare provider might also refer you to a skin specialist or dermatologist.\nOther non-pharmaceutical treatments for acne are:\n  * Photodynamic therapy where light is applied to the skin to improve acne (eg, laser).\n  * Chemical peels where a solution is applied to your face causing the skin to peel off.\n\n\nResults vary, so always consult with your healthcare provider first.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [skin check apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/s/skin-check-apps).\n####  Acne skin care tips \n  * Keep your skin clean with a gentle, non-abrasive cleanser.\n  * Don’t scrub your skin but use your fingertips to gently wash your face once or twice a day.\n  * Shampoo your hair regularly and keep your hair off your face.\n  * Avoid the sun and tanning beds as tanning damages your skin and can make your acne worse.\n  * Look for makeup brands designed for acne-prone skin, or labelled “non-comedogenic”.\n  * Always remove your makeup before going to sleep.\n  * Be careful, and use light pressure, when you shave your beard area if you have acne. Make sure you use a sharp blade.\n  * Don’t pick your skin or squeeze your pimples. This will only make things worse and could lead to scarring.\n  * If you’re using treatment, keep using it and give it time to work. It may take a while.\n\n\n####  VIDEO: What is the best way to treat acne? \nThere's no 100% cure for acne, but in this video Dr Mike Evans discusses how you can use step-up therapy successfully to reduce symptoms from 40 to 70%.   \n  \n\n(Dr Mike Evans, 2013)\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) | Huahua hua kūao](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/polycystic-ovary-syndrome)  \n[Isotretinoin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/i/isotretinoin)  \n[Adapalene](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/adapalene)  \n[Benzoyl peroxide](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/b/benzoyl-peroxide)  \n[Mental health topics](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/mental-health-topics)  \n[Mental health for kids](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/mental-health-for-kids)  \n[How to support a child or teenager with depression](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/depression-children-and-teenagers)\n####  More information \n[Adult acne(external link)](https://www.dermnetnz.org/topics/adult-acne/ \"Open external link\") DermNet, NZ  \n[What is Acne?(external link)](https://www.pcds.org.uk/files/pils/PIL-Acne.pdf \"Open external link\") The Primary Care Dermatology Society, UK  \n[What causes acne?(external link)](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/what-causes-acne \"Open external link\") DermNet NZ  \n[Acne(external link)](http://www.acne.org.au/ \"Open external link\") All About Acne, Australia  \n[Live well with acne and common myths explained(external link)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acne/causes/ \"Open external link\") NHS, UK\n#### Apps\n[Skin check apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/s/skin-check-apps)  \n\n#### Resources\n[What is acne?(external link)](http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Acne/acne_ff.pdf \"Open external link\") National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, US, [English(external link)](http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Acne/acne_ff.pdf \"Open external link\"), [Chinese(external link)](http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Chinese/Acne_chinese.pdf \"Open external link\"), [Korean(external link)](http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Korean/default.asp \"Open external link\"), [Vietnamese(external link)](http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Vietnamese/Acne_vietnamese.pdf \"Open external link\")\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
