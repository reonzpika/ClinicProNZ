## Sub-Accordion 1: "Generally NOT Suitable for 12 Months"

**Why NOT suitable:** Requires monitoring more often than annually

### Controlled Drugs (Legal Exclusion)

**Maximum duration:** 1-3 months (law, not clinical judgment)

| Class | Max Duration | Examples |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Class B** | 1 month | Morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, methylphenidate, dexamphetamine |
| **Class C** | 3 months | Tramadol, codeine (prescription strength), diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, zopiclone, zolpidem |

### High-Risk Medications Requiring Regular Monitoring

**Typical maximum:** 3 months

**Examples:**

- **Warfarin** - INR monitoring (weekly to monthly depending on stability)
- **Lithium** - Levels 3-monthly, renal + thyroid function 3-6 monthly
- **Digoxin** - Levels + renal function 3-6 monthly, ECG annually
- **Methotrexate** - FBC + LFTs monthly initially, then 2-3 monthly
- **Azathioprine** - FBC + LFTs monthly initially, then 3-monthly
- **Amiodarone** - TFTs + LFTs 6-monthly, CXR + ECG annually
- **Sodium valproate** - LFTs + FBC 6-monthly
- **Carbamazepine** - FBC + LFTs + Na+ 6-monthly
- **Insulin** - Regular dose adjustments needed

**Why unsuitable:** These medications need regular blood tests or monitoring that can't wait 12 months.

**→ Check NZF** for specific monitoring schedules and dose adjustments.

---

## Sub-Accordion 2: "Requires Individual Assessment"

**Why individual:** Suitability depends on patient parameters (eGFR, age, etc.)

**Action:** Check patient's specific values before deciding duration.

### Common Examples:

**Metformin**
- eGFR >45: Generally suitable for 12 months
- eGFR 30-45: Max 6 months (dose reduction may be needed)
- eGFR <30: Contraindicated
- **→ Check NZF** for exact dosing adjustments

**ACE Inhibitors / ARBs** (enalapril, lisinopril, irbesartan, losartan)
- eGFR ≥60: Generally suitable for 12 months
- eGFR 45-59: Consider 6-12 months
- eGFR 30-44: Max 6 months
- eGFR <30: Max 3-6 months, specialist input
- **→ Check NZF** for renal monitoring frequency

**DOACs** (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban)
- CrCl ≥50: Generally suitable for 12 months (varies by drug)
- CrCl <50: Shorter durations or dose adjustments needed
- **→ Check NZF** - thresholds differ by DOAC type

**Sulfonylureas** (gliclazide, glipizide)
- Age <70 + eGFR >60: Generally suitable for 12 months
- Age ≥70 OR eGFR <60: Consider 6 months (hypoglycaemia risk)
- **→ Check NZF** for renal dose adjustments

**NSAIDs** (naproxen, diclofenac, celecoxib)
- Young + normal renal function: 6-12 months if chronic use unavoidable
- With ACEi/ARB ("double whammy"): Max 6 months
- With ACEi/ARB + diuretic ("triple whammy"): Max 3 months
- **→ Check BPAC** for triple whammy guidance

**Spironolactone**
- MAX 6 months even when stable (needs K+ monitoring at 1 week, 1 month, then 6-monthly)
- **→ Check NZF** for monitoring protocol

**Allopurinol**
- eGFR >60: Generally suitable for 12 months
- eGFR <60: Consider 6 months (dose reduction needed)
- **→ Check NZF** for dose adjustments

**Other individual-assessment medications:**
- SGLT-2 inhibitors (empagliflozin) - eGFR-dependent
- Gabapentin/pregabalin - eGFR-dependent
- Bisphosphonates - eGFR-dependent
- Loop diuretics - Max 6 months (electrolyte monitoring)
- Levothyroxine - 12 months OK if dose stable 6+ months

**→ Always check NZF** for current monitoring requirements and dose adjustments.

## Sub-Accordion 3: "Generally Suitable for 12 Months"

**If patient stable:** These medications typically require only annual monitoring.

**Note:** "Generally suitable" does NOT mean "automatically 12 months for everyone." Patient must still be stable (condition controlled, dose unchanged).

### Common Examples:

**Cardiovascular:**
- Statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin)
- Calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, felodipine)
- Beta blockers (metoprolol, bisoprolol, atenolol)
- Aspirin (antiplatelet dose)

**Respiratory:**
- Inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone, budesonide)
- ICS/LABA combinations (Seretide, Symbicort)
- LAMA (tiotropium)
- Salbutamol

**Gastrointestinal:**
- PPIs (omeprazole, esomeprazole)

**Hormonal:**
- Oral contraceptives (annual BP check)
- Levothyroxine (if dose stable)

**Mental Health:**
- SSRIs/SNRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, venlafaxine)
  - **Must have annual discussion** about ongoing need
- Mirtazapine

**Diabetes:**
- DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin, sitagliptin)

**Other:**
- Calcium + Vitamin D
- Montelukast

**Typical annual monitoring:**
- BP (cardiovascular meds)
- Lipid profile (statins)
- TSH (levothyroxine)
- Spirometry (respiratory meds, if available)
- Inhaler technique check (respiratory meds)

**→ Check NZF** to confirm annual monitoring is sufficient for your patient.

## Important Notes Section

**Appears at bottom of accordion, always visible when expanded:**

### 🔴 Important Notes:

1. **These are EXAMPLES, not comprehensive lists.** Many medications not listed here may be suitable for 12 months. Always check NZF.

2. **Lists are GUIDANCE, not rules.** You have full clinical discretion. A medication in "Generally Suitable" may need 6 months in a particular patient.

3. **NZF is the authoritative source.** These lists are simplified for quick reference. For dose adjustments, monitoring frequency, and contraindications, always check NZF.

4. **When in doubt:** Prescribe a shorter duration (3 or 6 months). You can always extend next time.

5. **6 months is completely acceptable.** RNZCGP recommended 6 months as safer than 12 months. Don't feel pressured to prescribe 12 months.

## "About NZF Integration" Callout Box

**Design:** Light blue background box, positioned at top of accordion (above sub-accordions)

### Content:

> **Why we link to NZF instead of listing all medications**
>
> The New Zealand Formulary is the gold-standard, authoritative source for medication information in NZ. It's updated monthly and includes:
> - Monitoring requirements
> - Dose adjustments for renal/hepatic impairment
> - Drug interactions
> - Contraindications
> - Latest safety alerts
>
> Rather than duplicate (and risk outdating) this information, we link directly to NZF so you always have current data.
>
> **We've requested API access from NZF** to integrate medication data directly into this tool. If approved, future versions will auto-populate monitoring requirements without leaving this page.

### Colors:
- Use subtle background colors matching existing site palette
- Don't use bright red/amber/green (we're avoiding "zone" language)
- Use icons + text labels for accessibility

## Mobile Considerations

- All accordions stack vertically
- Tables in "Controlled Drugs" should be horizontally scrollable on mobile
- NZF link buttons should be full-width on mobile (<640px)
