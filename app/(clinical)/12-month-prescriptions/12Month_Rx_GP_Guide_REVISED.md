## 1. Background & Policy Overview

### What Changed

🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: From 1 February 2026, prescriptions may be written for up to **12 months** (increased from 3 months for most medicines, 6 months for oral contraceptives).
**SOURCE:** Medicines (Increasing the Period of Supply) Amendment Regulations 2025 (SL 2025/203)

🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: Dispensing limits remain **unchanged** - pharmacies can still only dispense a maximum of **3 months' supply** per occasion (6 months for oral contraceptives).
**SOURCE:** Medicines Regulations 2025, Regulation 42(3)(d)

🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: Prescriptions must be first presented to a pharmacy **within 3 months** of the issue date.
**SOURCE:** Medicines Regulations 2025, Regulation 42(3)(c)

### Who Decides Clinical Appropriateness

🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: The **prescriber** has full discretion to determine appropriate prescription duration based on individual patient assessment.
**SOURCE:** Medicines Regulations 2025; Ministry of Health Regulatory Impact Statement (21 November 2024)

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Government guidance suggests prescribers would consider 12-month prescriptions for patients with "ongoing, stable health conditions" but does not mandate criteria.
**SOURCE:** Ministry of Health RIS, page 15

### Cost Implications

🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: Patients pay **one prescription co-payment** ($5 for most) when first collecting their medicine. No additional co-payments for subsequent 3-monthly dispensings within that 12-month period.

## 3. Eligibility Framework

### CRITICAL CLARIFICATION

**There are NO mandatory patient eligibility criteria in the Medicines Regulations 2025.** The law grants full clinical discretion to prescribers. The criteria below are **professional guidance** to support safe decision-making.

### Patient Stability Criteria

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: RNZCGP patient materials suggest patients "may be eligible" if their condition and medication dose have been **stable for at least 6 months**.
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Patient Poster and FAQs (January 2026)

**NOTE:** This "6 months stable" criterion does NOT appear in:
- The Medicines Regulations 2025
- RNZCGP Position Statement (November 2025)
- RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1
- Pharmac Schedule Rules
- Any government guidance

🔵 **PRACTICE DECISION**: Individual practices may adopt this as policy or use different timeframes (some early adopters trialing 9-month prescriptions).

### Review Requirements

🟡 **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD**: Practices accredited under RNZCGP Foundation Standard must ensure **minimum annual review** for patients on 12-month prescriptions.
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1 (updated 01/11/25)

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: RNZCGP Position Statement recommends "continuity of care: consider attendance at reviews and follow-ups—a minimum of annual review is required, or earlier if clinically indicated."
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement, November 2025, page 3

🔵 **PRACTICE DECISION**: Some practices require face-to-face appointments for issuing 12-month prescriptions (e.g., The Doctors Napier).
**SOURCE:** NZ Herald, 1 February 2026

### Patient Groups Requiring Careful Consideration

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: RNZCGP Position Statement identifies patient groups where "12-month prescriptions **may not be suitable**" (note: not "excluded"):

**Age and life stage considerations:**
- Infants and children
- Adolescents
- Pregnant patients
- **Older adults (65+)** who typically require closer monitoring

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement, November 2025, page 3

**Complex clinical situations:**
- Patients with multiple or unstable conditions
- Polypharmacy patients who may require shorter intervals for timely review
- Patients with poor medication adherence
- Patients requiring caregiver/whānau support for medication management

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement, November 2025, page 3

**IMPORTANT:** These are considerations for clinical judgment, NOT absolute exclusions. The prescriber determines suitability for each individual patient.

**SOURCE:** Clinical consensus from early adopter practices; RNZCGP guidance materials

### 4.3 Gray Area Medications Requiring Individual Assessment

The following medications may be suitable for 12-month prescriptions in **selected stable patients** but require careful individual assessment:

#### ACE Inhibitors / ARBs

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Consider shorter intervals if:
- eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m² (increased risk of renal deterioration, hyperkalemia)
- Recent dose titration (<6 months)
- Concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs
- Unstable heart failure

**If prescribing for 12 months:** Ensure patient understands need for monitoring and has access to blood tests as clinically indicated.

**SOURCE:** Clinical best practice; RNZCGP Position Statement considerations

#### Metformin

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Consider shorter intervals if:
- eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m² (dose adjustment required)
- eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m² (contraindicated)
- Recent acute illness or hospitalisation
- Elderly patients at risk of declining renal function

**SOURCE:** Clinical best practice; Medsafe data sheets

#### Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran - consider shorter intervals if:
- eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m² (dose adjustment required; increased monitoring needed)
- Age >75 years (increased bleeding risk)
- High bleeding risk (falls, previous bleeds)
- Concurrent antiplatelet therapy

**SOURCE:** Clinical best practice; Medsafe data sheets

---

## 5. Monitoring Requirements

All monitoring recommendations below are 🟢 **GUIDANCE** based on clinical best practice, NOT legal requirements.

### General Principles

🟡 **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD**: RNZCGP Foundation Standard requires "annual reviews are a minimum, but more frequent assessments may be necessary based on patient condition and medication risks."
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Telehealth/phone reviews may be acceptable for stable patients between in-person reviews, at prescriber discretion.
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement

### Monitoring by Condition

**Hypertension on simple regimen (e.g., amlodipine alone):**
- Annual BP check, renal function, electrolytes
- Home BP monitoring encouraged

**Diabetes on metformin alone:**
- Annual HbA1c, renal function, lipids
- More frequent if eGFR <45

**Hyperlipidemia on statin:**
- Annual lipid profile
- LFTs not routinely required if stable (BPAC guidance)

**Asthma/COPD on maintenance inhalers:**
- Annual spirometry if available
- Annual review of inhaler technique and symptom control

**Polypharmacy (5+ medications):**
🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Consider 6-monthly reviews rather than annual for medication reconciliation and adverse effect screening.
**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement

---

## 6. Practical Implementation

### 6.1 Workflow from Early Adopters

🔵 **PRACTICE DECISION**: The following workflows are examples from early adopter practices. Your practice should develop its own process.

**Pinnacle Practices (Waikato/Gisborne PHO):**
- Considering trialing with **9-month prescriptions** initially
- Developing in-house policy with clear criteria
- Emphasis on equity lens in decision-making

**SOURCE:** Pinnacle Practices webinar, October 2025

**Some practices requiring:**
- Face-to-face appointment for issuing 12-month prescription
- Annual review booked at time of prescription issue
- Patient consent/agreement form

**SOURCE:** Various practice policies shared via Pinnacle

### 6.2 RNZCGP Foundation Standard Requirements

🟡 **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD**: For practices seeking/maintaining RNZCGP accreditation:

**Mandatory requirements:**
1. **Documented repeat prescribing policy** that includes clear criteria for when 12-month prescriptions are appropriate and when shorter intervals are clinically indicated

2. **Annual audits** of repeat prescribing activity

3. Audits must **differentiate Māori from non-Māori** in results to identify and address inequities

4. If audits show non-compliance, improvement actions and follow-up audits are required

5. **Patients requiring further examination or assessment must NOT receive repeat prescriptions without being seen** by a doctor or nurse practitioner

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1 (updated 01/11/25)

### 6.3 Documentation Recommendations

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Consider documenting in clinical notes:
- Clinical rationale for 12-month prescription
- Monitoring plan discussed with patient
- Next review date
- Patient agreement to annual review

🔵 **PRACTICE DECISION**: Some practices using consent forms or patient information leaflets.

---

## 7. Managing Patient Expectations

### Common Patient Questions

**"Can I get all my medicines for 12 months at once?"**
🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: No. Pharmacies can only dispense 3 months at a time (6 months for oral contraceptives). You'll collect repeats every 3 months from the same pharmacy.

**"Will I still need to see my doctor?"**
🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Yes. RNZCGP recommends annual review as minimum. Your doctor will decide appropriate review frequency based on your health needs.

**"Why can't I get a 12-month prescription?"**
Explain using appropriate marker:
- 🔴 If controlled drug: "This medication is a controlled drug and legally cannot be prescribed for more than [1 or 3] months"
- 🟢 If requires monitoring: "Your medication requires regular blood tests to ensure it's safe and working properly"
- 🟢 If unstable condition: "Your condition needs closer monitoring to ensure your treatment remains appropriate"

**"My friend got a 12-month prescription, why can't I?"**
🔴 **LEGAL REQUIREMENT**: "The law gives me discretion to determine the appropriate prescription length for each patient individually based on their specific health needs."

### Setting Expectations

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Be clear with patients that a 12-month prescription:
- Does NOT mean no contact with practice for 12 months
- Does NOT mean no monitoring required
- Can be changed/stopped if circumstances change
- Requires them to still attend annual reviews

---

## 8. Professional Concerns

### 8.1 RNZCGP Position

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: RNZCGP **opposed** the 12-month policy and formally recommended **6 months** as safer.

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: RNZCGP October 2024 submission to Ministry of Health:
> "Based on unprecedented member feedback, the College **does not support** the proposed amendment to increase the period of supply limit from 3 months to 12 months. It will however **support an increase to 6 months** as a safer and more appropriate option."

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Submission, 17 October 2024

**Reasons for opposition:**
- Primary risk: lack of appropriate follow-up over 12 months
- Equity concerns for Māori and Pacific peoples
- Financial impact on practices (estimated $320,000 loss for practice with 14,500 patients)
- Patient safety concerns for unstable conditions

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Submission, October 2024

Despite opposition, RNZCGP issued implementation guidance after government decision to proceed.

### 8.2 Pharmacy Sector

**Pharmacy Guild concerns:**
- Financial sustainability due to reduced dispensing fees for repeats
- Operational burden of managing 12-month prescriptions
- Technology gaps

**Resolution:** Te Whatu Ora agreed (November 2025) to fund pharmacies "as if they were still delivering them under 3-month prescription pricing terms."
**SOURCE:** Pharmacy Guild press release, 13 November 2025

**Pharmaceutical Society position:**
- Supports 12-month prescriptions with robust implementation
- Recommends prescribers add period of supply notation (2/12, 6/12, etc.) to prescriptions

**SOURCE:** PSNZ submission, 14 October 2024

## 9. Te Tiriti Considerations and Equity

### 9.1 Equity Concerns

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: Te Tirātū (Iwi Māori Partnership Board for Tainui waka rohe) raised significant equity concerns:

> "Māori already face significant barriers to accessing medicines. Despite higher rates of chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory illness, Māori are overall less likely to access dispensed medicines than non-Māori."

> "Māori already experience **lower rates of monitoring, fewer proactive clinical reviews**, and later diagnosis of chronic and complex conditions. Reducing prescribing touchpoints risks further decreasing opportunities to detect deterioration."

**SOURCE:** Te Tirātū position statement, 2 February 2026

### 9.2 Five Safeguards Requested

Te Tirātū called for:

1. **Mandatory equity-focused monitoring** with prescribing rates disaggregated by ethnicity, rurality, deprivation, disability

2. **Transparent reporting** of adverse events, hospitalisations, medicine changes, wastage

3. **Māori-led evaluation** of safety, trust, communication, cultural safety

4. **Clear national guidance** on who is NOT clinically appropriate

5. **Te Tiriti-aligned medicines optimisation strategy**

**SOURCE:** Te Tirātū position statement, 2 February 2026

### 9.3 Practice-Level Equity Actions

🟡 **PROFESSIONAL STANDARD**: RNZCGP Foundation Standard requires practices to:
- Include "additional measures to **optimise Māori access** to repeat prescriptions and collection of medicines" in policy
- **Differentiate Māori from non-Māori** in repeat prescribing audits

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1

🟢 **GUIDANCE**: RNZCGP Position Statement recommends:
- Apply equity lens to decision-making
- Ensure culturally safe care continues
- Consider barriers to access when determining prescription duration

**SOURCE:** RNZCGP Position Statement, November 2025

## Key Takeaway Messages

1. **You have full legal discretion** - the Medicines Regulations 2025 grant prescribers complete authority to determine appropriate prescription duration. There are no mandatory patient eligibility criteria in law.

2. **Eligibility criteria are guidance** - the "6 months stable" and other patient suitability factors are recommendations from RNZCGP and consumer information, NOT legal requirements.

3. **RNZCGP opposed this policy** - they recommended 6 months as safer. Their guidance reflects this caution.

4. **Accredited practices have standards to meet** - if your practice is RNZCGP-accredited, you must comply with Foundation Standard 9.1 requirements (policy, audits, Māori equity measures).

5. **Equity must be central** - Māori health advocates warn this policy risks widening inequities without proper safeguards. Monitor your prescribing patterns and outcomes.

6. **It's okay to prescribe shorter durations** - 6 months, 9 months, or any duration you deem appropriate is completely acceptable and often safer.

7. **Document your reasoning** - whatever duration you choose, document your clinical rationale.
