## 🔴 TIER 1: LEGAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST COMPLY)

**Source:** Medicines Regulations 2025, Misuse of Drugs Act 1975, Pharmac Schedule Rules

| What the Law Says | What This Means for You |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Prescriptions may be written for up to 12 months** | You CAN prescribe 12 months, but you're not required to |
| **Dispensing limited to 3 months per occasion** (6 months for oral contraceptives) | Patients collect 3-month supplies every 3 months from pharmacy |
| **First dispensing within 3 months** of prescription date | Patient must present prescription to pharmacy within 3 months |
| **Controlled drugs excluded** (Class B: max 1 month; Class C: max 3 months) | Morphine, methylphenidate, tramadol, benzodiazepines cannot be prescribed for 12 months |
| **Special Authority must be valid** for funded repeats | If SA expires during 12-month period, you must renew it before further funded dispensings |
| **One co-payment** when patient first collects medicine | Patient pays $5 once, not quarterly |

### Critical Legal Point:
**The law gives YOU full clinical discretion.** There are NO mandatory patient eligibility criteria, NO required "stability period", NO excluded patient groups in the Medicines Regulations 2025.

## 🟡 TIER 2: PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS (Required for RNZCGP Accreditation)

**Source:** RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1

If your practice is RNZCGP-accredited (or seeking accreditation), you MUST:

| Requirement | Deadline/Frequency |
|-------------|-------------------|
| ✓ Have a **documented repeat prescribing policy** that includes clear criteria for when 12-month prescriptions are appropriate | Required now |
| ✓ Conduct **annual audits** of repeat prescribing | Annually |
| ✓ **Differentiate Māori from non-Māori** in audit results to identify inequities | Each audit |
| ✓ Take improvement actions if audits show non-compliance | As needed |
| ✓ Ensure **minimum annual review** for patients on repeat prescriptions | Ongoing |
| ✓ Include "additional measures to **optimise Māori access**" in policy | Required now |
| ✓ **Do NOT issue repeats** to patients who need examination without seeing them | Ongoing |

### What Happens If You Don't Comply?
- You may **lose RNZCGP accreditation**
- Your practice's Foundation Standard status may be affected
- Audit findings must be discussed at clinical governance meetings

### What If Your Practice Isn't RNZCGP-Accredited?
These become **strong recommendations** (Tier 3) but are not mandatory. However, the Medical Council's Good Prescribing Practice expects documented processes for repeat prescribing.

## 🟢 TIER 3: PROFESSIONAL GUIDANCE (Recommended Best Practice)

**Sources:** RNZCGP Position Statement, Healthify, PSNZ, clinical consensus

These are **recommendations to guide your clinical judgment** - you have discretion to follow or adapt them.

### Patient Eligibility Criteria (🟢 GUIDANCE)

| Criterion | Source | Your Discretion |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Condition stable for **6 months** | RNZCGP patient materials | You can use different timeframe (3, 9, 12 months) |
| Medication dose stable for **6 months** | RNZCGP patient materials | You can assess stability differently |
| **Annual review minimum** | RNZCGP Position Statement | You can require more frequent reviews |
| Consider carefully for **age 65+** | RNZCGP Position Statement | Age alone is not exclusion - use clinical judgment |
| Consider carefully for **children, pregnant, polypharmacy** | RNZCGP Position Statement | These are considerations, not exclusions |

### Medication Suitability (🟢 GUIDANCE)

| Generally UNSUITABLE | Reason | Your Discretion |
|---------------------|---------|----------------|
| Warfarin, lithium, digoxin | Requires regular monitoring | You can prescribe shorter duration or decide monitoring schedule works |
| Methotrexate, azathioprine | Immunosuppressant monitoring | Same as above |
| Amiodarone | Multiple monitoring needs | Same as above |

| Generally SUITABLE | Your Discretion |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Statins, CCBs, beta blockers | You can still choose shorter duration if clinically indicated |
| Inhaled steroids, LABA/LAMA | Same as above |
| Levothyroxine | Same as above |

### RNZCGP's Position

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** RNZCGP **opposed** 12-month prescriptions and recommended **6 months** as safer (October 2024 submission to Ministry of Health).

Their guidance reflects this caution - you can legitimately prescribe 6-month prescriptions instead of 12-month as a safety measure.

---

## 🔵 TIER 4: INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE DECISIONS

**Sources:** Early adopter practices, PHO guidance

Your practice determines:

| Practice Decision | Examples from Early Adopters |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| **Prescription duration** you're comfortable with | Some practices trialing 9 months instead of 12 months |
| **Face-to-face requirement** for issuing 12-month scripts | Some practices require F2F, others allow phone/video |
| **Documentation requirements** | Some use consent forms, others just clinical notes |
| **Which medications** your practice includes | Some practices more conservative on "gray area" drugs |
| **Review booking process** | Some book annual review when issuing script |
| **Staff training approach** | Varies by practice |
| **Patient information materials** | Customize to your practice |

---

## Common Misconceptions - CORRECTED

| ❌ MISCONCEPTION | ✅ REALITY | Authority Level |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| "Patients must be stable for 6 months" | This is guidance from patient materials, not law | 🟢 GUIDANCE |
| "Patients over 65 cannot get 12-month scripts" | Age is a consideration for clinical judgment, not exclusion | 🟢 GUIDANCE |
| "Annual review is legally required" | Required for RNZCGP accreditation, not by law | 🟡 STANDARD |
| "Warfarin is legally excluded" | Unsuitable due to monitoring needs, not legal exclusion | 🟢 GUIDANCE |
| "I must issue 12-month prescriptions if patients ask" | You have full discretion to issue shorter durations | 🔴 LAW (discretion granted) |
| "Same pharmacy is legally required" | Appears in guidance/materials but not explicit in Schedule Rules | Operational |

## Quick Decision Guide: "What MUST I Do vs What SHOULD I Consider?"

### MUST (🔴 Legal or 🟡 Standard for accredited practices):
- ✓ Not prescribe controlled drugs for >1-3 months
- ✓ Ensure Special Authority valid for funded repeats
- ✓ Have documented repeat prescribing policy (if accredited)
- ✓ Conduct annual audits with Māori/non-Māori differentiation (if accredited)
- ✓ Not issue repeats without seeing patients who need examination (if accredited)

### SHOULD CONSIDER (🟢 Guidance):
- ✓ Is condition stable? (you define "stable")
- ✓ Does medication require regular monitoring?
- ✓ Is patient in higher-risk group? (age, polypharmacy, etc.)
- ✓ Will patient attend annual review?
- ✓ Equity considerations for this patient

### CAN DECIDE (🔵 Practice):
- ✓ Use 6, 9, or 12 months based on your clinical judgment
- ✓ Require face-to-face or allow phone/video
- ✓ Use consent forms or just document in notes
- ✓ Set your own "stability" criteria

## The Bottom Line

**1. The law is permissive, not prescriptive:** You CAN prescribe 12 months; you're not required to.

**2. RNZCGP opposed this policy:** They recommended 6 months as safer. Their guidance reflects caution.

**3. Accreditation has requirements:** If you're RNZCGP-accredited, you must have policy, audits, and equity measures.

**4. Clinical judgment is paramount:** You determine what's appropriate for each patient.

**5. Six months is completely acceptable:** Despite the policy being called "12-month prescriptions," prescribing for 6 months aligns with RNZCGP's position and is often safer.

## When in Doubt:

- **Legal question?** → Check Medicines Regulations 2025
- **Accreditation question?** → Check RNZCGP Foundation Standard 9.1
- **Clinical question?** → Use your professional judgment with RNZCGP guidance
- **Practice implementation question?** → Decide what works for your practice
