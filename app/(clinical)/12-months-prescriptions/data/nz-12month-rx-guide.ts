# New Zealand's 12-Month Prescription Policy: GP Decision Support Guide

**Updated February 2026**

---

## Overview

From 1 February 2026, prescribers in New Zealand can issue prescriptions for up to 12 months of supply (previously 3 months maximum). This guide provides decision support for GPs.

---

## Legal Framework

- **Medicines (Increasing the Period of Supply) Amendment Regulations 2025** (SL 2025/203)
- The law permits up to 12 months; it does not require it
- Controlled drugs remain limited (Class B: 1 month, Class C: 3 months)

---

## Key Points

1. **Full clinical discretion** - No mandatory eligibility criteria
2. **Patient collects 3-monthly** from same pharmacy
3. **One $5 co-payment** per year
4. **RNZCGP recommended 6 months** as safer than 12 in their submission

## Professional Guidance vs Legal Requirements

The "eligibility criteria" often discussed are professional guidance (e.g. BPAC, RNZCGP), not legal requirements. Use clinical judgment.
