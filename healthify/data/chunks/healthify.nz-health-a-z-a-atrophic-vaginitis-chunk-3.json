  "content": "* Don’t use vaginal douches. You don’t need to clean inside your vagina as it’s self-cleaning.\n  * Use emollient cream or petroleum jelly if your vulva is dry or itchy.\n  * Try a vaginal moisturiser.\n  * Use a water-based vaginal lubricant when you have sex.\n  * Some medicines may cause vaginal dryness, eg, anticholinergics, antihistamines, decongestants, antidepressants. If you take medicines, talk to your healthcare provider about whether vaginal dryness could be a side effect. If so there may be an alternative you could take instead.\n  * Avoid perfumed soaps, shampoos, antiseptics, bubble baths or other products that could irritate your skin.\n  * Wear cotton underwear and change your underwear each day. Natural fibres such as cotton are more breathable which allows airflow around the skin and keeps it healthy.\n  * Prioritise your sexual health. Discuss the impacts of your symptoms with your partner. ",
