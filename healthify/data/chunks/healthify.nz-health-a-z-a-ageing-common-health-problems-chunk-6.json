  "content": "It will help if you:\n  * brush your teeth twice a day and floss (or use an interdental cleaner) once a day\n  * have regular check-ups.\n\n\n####  Skin \nAgeing skin gets thinner,becomes more fragile and bruises more easily. It may get drier as the natural oils decrease. Wrinkles, age spots and skin tags may appear. \nIt will help if you:\n  * are gentle with your skin, bathe in warm rather than hot water, use mild soaps and moisturiser\n  * use [sunscreen](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sunscreen \"Sunscreen\") and cover up when outside\n  * don’t smoke.\n\n\n####  Weight \nYour metabolism slows down as you get older, meaning that you don’t burn calories in the same way. If you continue to eat the same amount you can put on weight. \nIt will help if you:\n  * stay physically active every day\n  * eat a healthy diet\n  * watch your portion sizes, or how much you eat.\n\n\nRead more about [serving sizes for people of different ages.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/f/food-groups-serving-size \"Food groups & serving size\")\n####  Sexuality \nYour sexual needs and enjoyment may change as you get older. Sex may become uncomfortable for women due to vaginal dryness and men may find it more difficult to get or keep an erection. \nIt will help if you:\n  * talk to your partner about what is happening for you and what you need\n  * remain physically active\n  * talk to your healthcare provider as there may be treatment that can help.\n\n\nRead more about [sex and ageing.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sex-and-ageing \"Sex and ageing\")\n####  When to seek medical advice \nAlthough some functional changes can be explained by natural ageing processes, it's important to seek advice from a healthcare provider if you have any concerns that something else might be going on. \nIf you notice changes in your patterns (sleep, bowel, appetite) or other symptoms (pain, shortness of breath) don’t assume it’s something you have to put up with just because you’re getting older. There may be a treatable reason, so talk to your healthcare provider and make a plan to improve your quality of life. \nTalk to your doctor or healthcare provider if you are experiencing any of these:\n  * frequent falls – also see [falls prevention](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/falls-and-falls-prevention)\n  * significant memory loss\n  * incontinence\n  * difficulty in walking\n  * [anxiety ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anxiety)or [depressed mood](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/depression-later-life)\n  * [painful joints](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/arthritis)\n  * change in your bowel habit such as [constipation](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/constipation-in-adults), blood in your poo (faeces, stools) or diarrhoea (runny poo)\n  * [pains in your chest](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chest-pain) or [indigestion](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/i/indigestion)\n  * breathing problems.\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Ageing topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ageing-topics)  \n[Eyes and ageing](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/e/eyes-and-ageing \"Eyes and ageing\")\n####  More information \n#### Apps\n[Exercise apps for older adults](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/exercise-apps-for-older-adults)  \n[Healthy ageing and wellness apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/h/healthy-ageing-apps)  \n[Self-management and healthy living apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/h/healthy-living-apps)\n#### Resources\n[Eating for healthy older people(external link)(external link)](https://www.healthed.govt.nz/system/files/resource-files/HE1145_Eating%20for%20healthy%20older%20people_0.pdf \"Open external link\") HealthEd, NZ, 2021  \n[Physical activity for older people (65+)(external link)(external link)](http://www.health.govt.nz/system/files/documents/publications/physical-activity-for-older-people-factsheet-v2.pdf \"Open external link\") Ministry of Health, NZ, 2013  \n[People living in aged residential care(external link)(external link)](https://www.hqsc.govt.nz/assets/Our-work/Improved-service-delivery/Aged-residential-care/Publications-resources/InterRAI-infographic-Feb-2020.pdf \"Open external link\") interRAI, NZ, 2020\n#### References\n  1.
