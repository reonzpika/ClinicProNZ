  "content": "It's safe to be vaccinated while hāpu and is recommended for all pregnant people. Get the flu vaccine as soon as it is available, whether you're in your first, second or third trimester at the time.\nIf you catch COVID-19 when you’re pregnant, you’re more likely to become very unwell, so it’s a good idea to get vaccinated or get your booster when you become eligible. You can get a COVID-19 vaccine at any stage of your pregnancy.\nPertussis vaccine protects against the bacterial infection [whooping cough](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/w/whooping-cough) (also called pertussis) that causes uncontrollable coughing. Complications can be serious, including pneumonia and seizures. You should have the pertussis vaccine preferably within the second trimester of pregnancy, from 16 weeks, but at least 2 weeks before the birth of your baby. When you receive the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy, your baby is protected from severe whooping cough for the first few weeks after birth, but they should then be vaccinated themselves at the age of 6 weeks.\nRead more about [vaccinations and pregnancy.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation)\n####   \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps), [breathing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/breathing-apps), and [pregnancy apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pregnancy-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Asthma in adults](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/asthma-adults \"Asthma in adults\")  \n[Pregnancy topics](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy \"Pregnancy topics\")  \n[Vaccinations and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/pregnancy-immunisation \"Vaccinations and pregnancy\")  \n[Smoking and pregnancy](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-and-pregnancy)\n####  More information \n[Asthma and pregnancy(external link)](https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/related-conditions/existing-health-conditions/asthma/ \"Open external link\") NHS, UK  \n[Asthma in pregnancy toolkit(external link)](https://www.sign.ac.uk/media/1140/pat158_pregnancy.pdf \"Open external link\") Centre of Excellence in Treatable Traits, Australia\n####    \nResources\n[Asthma self management plan(external link)](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/assets.asthmafoundation.org.nz/documents/Asthma-Self-Management-Plan-Resource.pdf \"Open external link\") The Asthma and Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2013  \n[GINA patient guide for asthma – you can control your asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/GINA-Patient-Guide-Feb-2022.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2021   \n[Asthma checklist(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Asthma-Checklist.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ  \n[Your unborn child, asthma, and allergies(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Your-Unborn-Child-Asthma-Allergies-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010  \n[Women and asthma(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/assets/documents/Women-Asthma-Fact-Sheet.pdf \"Open external link\") Asthma Respiratory Foundation NZ, 2010\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
