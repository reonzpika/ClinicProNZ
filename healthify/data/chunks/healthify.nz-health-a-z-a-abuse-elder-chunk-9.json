  "content": "Abusers are often someone they depend on or live with. They may not realise what’s happening.\nIt's important not to jump to conclusions – the older person’s whole situation needs to be considered. There may be other health or family reasons for the things you notice.\n  * changes in behaviour, sleeping or eating habits\n  * withdrawal and/or edginess\n  * crying, talking about feeling hopeless, sad or helpless\n  * unexplained injuries\n  * drowsiness (due to over-medication)\n  * fear of a particular person or avoiding looking at or talking to them\n  * pulling back from touch, trembling or having a rigid posture\n  * unusual withdrawals from bank accounts or unusual decisions about property or other assets\n  * unpaid bills and/or not enough money for necessities  \n\n  * hesitating to talk openly and waiting for the caregiver to answer\n  * seeming to contradict themselves even though they're not confused.\n\n\n####  What can I do if I have concerns about elder abuse? \nIf you’re worried about how an older person is being treated, think about whether you can talk with them privately. You could ask:\n  * How are things going at home/in residential care?\n  * How do you feel your caregiver is managing?\n  * Are you OK?\n  * Is someone hurting you? \n\n\n**If you or another older person is experiencing abuse**\n  * Talk to someone you trust – a friend or someone in your family/whānau.\n  * Talk to someone you see regularly – a doctor, nurse, member of your church or spiritual leader.\n  * Talk confidentially with a worker from an agency with experience in dealing sensitively with elder abuse, such as Age Concern.\n  * Visit [Age Concern elder abuse services(external link)](https://ageconcern.org.nz/Public/Public/Info/Services/Elder_abuse_and_neglect/Where_to_get_help.aspx?hkey=f91e2272-b165-4ce5-9321-6f6a5a3dc8c6 \"Open external link\") to find your nearest service.

Where older people’s choices are being undermined or over-ridden by others, it's important to question whether their human rights are being supported.  \n  \nTo help prevent elder abuse, older people should be:\n  * loved and cherished\n  * spoken and listened to respectfully, upholding their mana\n  * included in social activities\n  * phoned or visited regularly\n  * supported to spend their money how they wish\n  * encouraged and supported to make their own decisions\n  * enabled to set their own pace.\n\n\n####  Videos: Elder abuse \n#### Video: Hidden harm – psychological abuse of older people  \n  \n\n(Office for seniors, NZ, 2025)\n####    \nVideo: Elder abuse – the signs of financial abuse  \n  \n\n(Office for Seniors, NZ, 2025)\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Ageing – common health conditions](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/ageing-common-health-problems \"Ageing – what is normal and when to seek medical advice\")  \n[Dementia | Mate wareware](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dementia \"Dementia | Mate korongenge\")  \n[Simple ways to support older people in your community](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/supporting-older-people \"Simple ways to support older people in your community\")  \n[Family violence](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/family-violence-overview \"Family violence\")\n####  More information \n[Elder abuse and neglect(external link)](https://www.ageconcern.org.nz/Public/Public/Info/Health_Topics/Elder_Abuse.aspx?hkey=b1b61000-c3c2-4ee3-98f0-d9e1dc935cbb \"Open external link\") Age Concern, NZ   \n[Identifying elder abuse(external link)](https://www.superseniors.msd.govt.nz/our-work/raising-awareness-of-elder-abuse/identifying-elder-abuse \"Open external link\") Office for Seniors Te Tari Kaumātua, NZ  \n[Abuse of older people(external link)](http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/elder-abuse \"Open external link\") World Health Organization  \n[Financial abuse(external link)](https://www.govt.nz/browse/law-crime-and-justice/abuse-harassment-domestic-violence/financial-abuse/ \"Open external link\") New Zealand Government\n####    \nBrochures\n[10 tips to be kind and stop elder abuse(external link)](https://healthify.nz/assets/eanp-10-tips_2020-1.pdf \"Open external link\") Age Concern, NZ, 2020  \n[It’s your money, and your choice(external link)](https://www.ageconcern.org.nz/common/Uploaded%20files/Age%20Concern_Its%20Your%20Money.pdf \"Open external link\") Age Concern, 2023  \n[Do you have questions about the safety of an older person/kaumātua?(external link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyLUCtB3254ZRyZvjK7bvXpg7XYEZRPr/view \"Open external link\") Age Concern, NZ, 2018\n####    \nReferences\n  1.
