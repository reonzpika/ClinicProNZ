Symptoms are similar to those of haemorrhoids (piles) so don’t assume that’s what you have, get checked out.\n  * People more at risk of anal cancer are those with a compromised immune system, smokers and those who’ve had HPV related conditions.\n  * Anal cancer is treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the likely outcome is good if it’s caught early.\n\n\n![Family walking dog on the beach NZ HN 950x690](https://healthify.nz/assets/NZ-outdoors/Family-walking-dog-on-beach-Healthify-950x690.png)\n####  What is anal cancer? \nThe anus is the last 4 cm of the digestive tract. The function of the anus is a sphincter to hold the bowel motion in the rectum until you wish to go to the loo. ",
