  "content": "* Try to use simple, short and clear sentences – one topic at a time.\n  * Use simple and easy gestures with your speech to support what you're talking about.\n  * Always have a pen and paper with you to write down the key points, or do drawings. Some people will find writing or reading easier than talking.\n  * Use yes/no questions – eg, ‘Do you want an apple?’ not ‘What do you want to eat?’\n  * Provide options – eg, ‘Do you need to visit the supermarket or the bank?’\n  * Be honest if you don't understand and double check that they have understood what you said.\n  * To help understanding of lengthy or complex information, break the information into smaller chunks.\n  * If frustration or tiredness is affecting your communication, agree to take a break and come back to it later.\n  ",
