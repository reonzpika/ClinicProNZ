  "content": "You'll be advised not to do any heavy lifting or straining for about a week. This is to prevent bleeding from the insertion site.\nAfter an angioplasty you may go home that evening or stay the night in hospital and go home the following day. You will need to arrange for someone to take you home.\nBefore leaving hospital you'll be started on medicines, which must be continued when you go home. These will help prevent further heart problems. To prevent blood clots forming, you'll be given medicines including[aspirin](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/aspirin-low-dose \"Aspirin\")[clopidogrel](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/c/clopidogrel \"Clopidogrel\")[ticagrelor](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/ticagrelor \"Ticagrelor\"). You should also take cholesterol-lowering medications ([statins](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/s/statins \"Statins\")) which help protect you from further narrowings in the heart arteries and often you will also be prescribed medicines to lower your blood pressure. Always follow your doctor's instructions and don't stop taking any medicines without talking to your healthcare provider first.\n####  Getting the most from your angioplasty \nAfter an angioplasty most people return to normal, everyday activities within 1–2 days of returning home, and can usually return to work after a week.\nRemember that having an angioplasty is not a cure for heart disease. Your symptoms may have stopped, but you will still need to make, and maintain, changes to your lifestyle to prevent the [angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina) returning. The best way to prevent further heart disease is to reduce or remove any risk factors. Every risk factor you reduce or remove can have a major effect on lowering your chances of having further heart disease problems, eg, angina or a heart attack. \nLearn more about: \n  * [stopping smoking](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-topics)\n  * [exercise and physical activity](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/e/exercise-how-to-get-moving-more-every-day)\n  * [eating and drinking for a healthy heart(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/wellbeing/healthy-eating/eating-for-a-healthy-heart \"Open external link\")\n  * [reaching a healthy weight.](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/w/weight-loss \"Weight loss\")\n\n\nYou may also be invited to go on a [cardiac rehabilitation programme](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/h/heart-disease-cardiac-rehabilitation).\n####  When can I drive again? \nThe New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA)[cardiovascular guide(external link)](https://www.nzta.govt.nz/ \"Open external link\") states you mustn't drive for at least 2 days after an angioplasty.\nIf you have complications from the procedure, or you have had a heart attack resulting in angioplasty, you must not drive until you have been given medical clearance – this is generally 2 weeks for a car licence.\nIf you hold a vocational licence (eg, you drive passenger vehicles, trucks, forklifts, courier vans or fly aeroplanes) different rules apply. Your licence needs to be approved by a cardiologist or specialist who will examine you and make sure it's safe for you to drive.\nIt also pays to check with your insurance company to ensure you're fully covered.\n####  Are there any risks or complications of angioplasty? \nAll types of surgery have a risk of complications, but the risk of serious problems is small. Coronary angioplasty doesn't involve major surgery and doctors describe it as a minimally invasive form of treatment.\n####    \nRisk factors\nOverall, the risk of serious complications from a coronary angioplasty is small, but this depends on factors such as:\n  * whether the procedure was planned or was an emergency treatment\n  * your age\n  * your general health\n  * whether you've had a heart attack.\n\n\nYour healthcare provider can give you more information about your individual risks and benefits.\n####    \nPossible complications\n  * It's quite common to have some discomfort, bleeding or bruising under the skin where the catheter was inserted.\n  * Some people may be allergic to the contrast agent used during the procedure. \n  * More serious complications are less common but can include damage to the artery where the angioplasty was done, severe bleeding requiring a blood transfusion or a heart attack, heart rhythm problems, kidney problems, stroke or death.\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina \"Angina\")  \n[Heart failure | Manawa ngoikore](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-failure \"Heart failure | Manawa ngoikore\")  \n[](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-attack \"Heart attack | Hē manawa\")[Heart attack | Hē manawa](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-attack \"Heart attack | Hē manawa\")\n####  More information \n[Angioplasty – explained(external link)](http://watchlearnlive.heart.org/CVML_Player.php?moduleSelect=angiop \"Open external link\")Watch, learn, live – interactive cardiovascular library – American Heart Association  \n[Coronary stent – explained(external link)](http://watchlearnlive.heart.org/CVML_Player.php?moduleSelect=cstent \"Open external link\") Watch, learn, live – interactive cardiovascular library – American Heart Association\n#### Resources\n  \n[A guide to coronary angiography & angioplasty(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/coronary-angiography-and-angioplasty-2019.pdf?mtime=1667526706?1669351478 \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ\n#### References\n  1.
