  "content": "Once you have had an anaphylactic reaction you will be referred to a specialist to help you work out your triggers. This may involve allergy testing or food/drug challenge.\nKnowing your triggers for anaphylaxis is essential. In many cases avoidance is the only way to prevent anaphylaxis. Your specialist will help you work out ways to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis. This usually includes writing up an emergency anaphylaxis action plan. You will need to have regular reassessment, to check if the allergy is still present and to make sure your prevention plan is working for you.\nCarrying your adrenaline auto-injector with you at all times if you have one and using it if you think you may have anaphylaxis can also help to prevent your anaphylaxis from getting worse.\n####  What support is available with anaphylaxis? \nIt can be frightening if you have anaphylaxis. Talk through your feelings with your family/whānau members or health professionals taking care of you. Read more about how to talk about your feelings. \nBelow are some support services and information for people affected by anaphylaxis and their family/whānau:\n[Allergy NZ(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")Check their website or phone 0800 34 0800 for information and support.   \n[EpiPen(external link)](https://www.myepipen.co.nz/ \"Open external link\") Online educational resource where you can access additional information about anaphylaxis and EpiPen®.\n####  Be prepared with an anaphylaxis action plan \nAn action plan for anaphylaxis provides a course of action to follow in the event of an allergic reaction, which is often due to food allergy or insect stings. Susceptible people and their families should be able to recognise the symptoms of anaphylaxis and know in advance what to do in an emergency.  \n  \nA copy of your Anaphylaxis Action Plan, filled in and signed by your doctor or nurse specialist, should be kept with your EpiPen and taken with you wherever you go. A copy should be given to your child’s early childhood centre or school, or kept at your workplace.  \n  \nAnaphylaxis action plans are produced by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) and are updated regularly. Your doctor or nurse specialist should review these regularly with you. Go through these action plans with your healthcare providers and ask any questions if you are unsure.​\n#### Action plan for EpiPen\n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_EpiPen_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for EpiPen general use\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 EpiPen®(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_EpiPen_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or to be stored with general use EpiPen® adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### General anaphylaxis action plan \n[ASCIA action plan for anaphylaxis (red) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Anaphylaxis_General_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who have been prescribed any brand of adrenaline auto-injectors. \n#### Action plan poster for general anaphylaxis\n[ASCIA first aid plan for anaphylaxis (orange) 2025 general(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_First_Aid_Plan_for_Anaphylaxis_General_2025_update.pdf \"Open external link\") – for use as a poster or stored with general use adrenaline auto-injectors.   \n\n#### Action plan for allergic reactions\n[ASCIA action plan for allergic reactions (green) 2025(external link)](https://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/2025/ASCIA_Action_Plan_Allergic_Reactions_2025.pdf \"Open external link\") – for people with allergies who haven't been prescribed adrenaline auto-injectors. \n####   \nFirst aid treatment for anaphylaxis\nAnaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction and potentially life threatening.
