(+ VIDEO) \nAotearoa New Zealand has one of the highest rates of asthma in the world – asthma affects up to 1 in 7 children and 1 in 8 adults. It's more common among Māori adults and tamariki.\nIf you have asthma, your airways are sensitive and react to certain triggers such as allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction), viruses, cold or humid weather, exercise and air pollutants such as cigarette smoke.\nThese triggers cause your air passages to tighten up, swell on the inside (become inflamed) and produce more mucus. As a result, the airways become narrower, making it difficult for air to move into your lungs, and even more difficult for air to move out.\n####    \nVideo: What is asthma?
