  "content": "Angina is caused by a temporary reduction in the blood flow to part of your heart muscle, a heart attack is caused by an actual blockage.\nAngina doesn’t damage your heart muscle but a heart attack causes permanent damage.\nAngina is usually eased fairly quickly by resting and using GTN spray, but with a heart attack the pain can last longer than 15 minutes and rest and GTN spray doesn’t help.\n**If you think you might be having a heart attack, call 111 for an ambulance.  \n  \n**\n!",
