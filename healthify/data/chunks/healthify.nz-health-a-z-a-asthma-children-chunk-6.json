  "content": "In asthma, your child's airways are inflamed and there is:\n  * swelling of the airway wall\n  * an increase in mucus or phlegm\n  * tightening of the muscle in the airway wall.\n\n\nThese changes cause narrowing of your child's airways. This leads to wheezing, cough and difficulty with breathing.\nWheezing is a musical, whistly sound that tamariki make, usually when breathing out. It can also happen when they breathe in. The sound comes from their chest, not from their nose or throat.\n",
