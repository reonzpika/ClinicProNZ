  "content": "You might want to arrange for somebody to drive you home afterwards in case you have any discomfort.\n####  What happens during an amniocentesis? \nYou will be able to have a partner or support person with you before and throughout the procedure. You will have an [ultrasound scan](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/u/ultrasound) so the doctor doing the amniocentesis can see where your baby is positioned and find the safest place to take a sample of amniotic fluid.   \n  \nYou may have the area numbed with local anaesthetic before a thin needle is inserted through the wall of your uterus into the sac containing the amniotic fluid surrounding your baby. A small amount of fluid (about 30mls) is removed. Your baby will be checked afterwards to make sure all is well.   \n  \nThe procedure should be no more painful than having a blood test, but there may be some discomfort afterwards. \n####  What happens after the amniocentesis? \nTake it easy for a day or so and get some rest. If you have any bleeding or fluid loss through your vagina, let your healthcare provider know and rest in bed until the problem resolves. There may be some soreness where the needle went in.\nContact your healthcare provider urgently if you experience any of these:\n  * Bleeding or loss of fluid through your vagina.\n  * Severe cramping lasting more than a few hours.\n  * A[fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/f/fever-adults)(temperature higher than 38º\n  * Redness where the needle went in.\n\n\n####  What are the risks? \nAmniocentesis is a relatively safe procedure but there are some risks:\n  * **Leaking amniotic fluid:**\n  * **Needle injury:**\n  * **Rhesus sensitization (making antibodies against your baby’s blood cells):**\n  * **Miscarriage:**\n\n\n####  Getting the results \nIt can take a couple of weeks for the results to be ready. The results will be sent to your healthcare provider who will discuss them with you.\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Antenatal blood tests](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pregnancy-blood-tests \"Antenatal blood tests\")\n####  More information \n[Amniocentesis – a patient's guide(external link)](https://www.familydoctor.co.nz/categories/pregnancy-and-birth/amniocentisis-a-patients-guide/ \"Open external link\") Family Doctor, NZ\n#### Apps\n[Pregnancy apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pregnancy-apps)\n#### References\n  1.
