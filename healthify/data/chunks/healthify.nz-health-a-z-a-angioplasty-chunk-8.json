  "content": "You should take all your medicines to hospital with you.\n####  After the procedure \nWhen you return to the ward the nursing staff will monitor you closely until you're fully recovered. If the catheter was in your groin, it's usually removed about 2 to 4 hours after you get back to the ward. If the catheter was in your arm, it will be removed at the end of the procedure. \nIt's normal to have some bruising around the site and for it to be slightly tender. If you experience discomfort at the site, inform the nurse and you will be given pain relief. You may feel a small lump where the catheter was inserted, but this should disappear over the next few months. If this increases in size or becomes painful, seek medical advice.\n####  Before leaving hospital \nBefore you go home, a nurse will teach you how to check the site for bleeding and explain what to do if this happens.
