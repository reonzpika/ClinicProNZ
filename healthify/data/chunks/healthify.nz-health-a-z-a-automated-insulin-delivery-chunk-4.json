  "content": "Any CGMs provided to replace faulty ones would not count towards your annual limit.\n  * **Broken or lost insulin pumps:** If your insulin pump is broken or lost, talk to the supplier about your options. But be aware that you may need to pay for a replacement. Pharmac funds 1 new insulin pump every 4 years which is the warranty period on insulin pumps. You may be able to claim a broken or lost insulin pump on your household insurance.\n  * **Broken or lost CGMs:** There's a limit on the total number of CGMs you can have each year that takes this into account. If you’ve used more than the limit, you may need to pay for more CGMs. Check how many CGMs you can get.\n\n\n####    \nAlways be prepared\n  * **Ask your healthcare provider about an action plan so you know what to do if your insulin pump stops working.** If this happens, contact the helpline of the insulin pump supplier for a replacement and let your diabetes nurse specialist know. You should get a back-up pump within 24h. In the meantime, give yourself insulin using an insulin pen within 4 hours of the pump stopping guided by your pump records.\n  * **Ensure you have enough insulin for emergencies.** As part of your emergency planning, you should have any medication or equipment supply for at least three days. The Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump has a rechargeable battery, which needs power to re-charge. The mylife YpsoPump uses AAA batteries. It's a good idea to keep spare batteries and some charging packs for your phone and your pump in your grab bag and make sure you also have spare consumables.\n\n\n#### Travelling with diabetes\n  * [Diabetes and travelling(external link)](https://www.diabetes.org.nz/managing-diabetes-travelling-2 \"Open external link\") Diabetes New Zealand\n  * [Navigating airport security screening: Guidance for people living with diabetes(external link)](https://www.aviation.govt.nz/assets/passenger/posters-and-flyers/AvSec-Diabetes-Guidance.pdf \"Open external link\") Aviation Security Service, NZ\n  * [Travelling with children who have diabetes(external link)](https://www.kidshealth.org.nz/diabetes/travelling-with-children-who-have-diabetes \"Open external link\") KidsHealth NZ\n  * [Travel(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/fact-sheets/fact-sheet-travel.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n  * [Travel and type 1 diabetes(external link)](https://www.ndss.com.au/wp-content/uploads/resources/booklet-young-people-travel-type1-diabetes.pdf \"Open external link\") Diabetes Australia\n\n\n#### Disposing of your insulin pump\nInsulin pumps consist of the pump itself, a disposable reservoir to store the insulin, and a disposable infusion set. The insulin pump insertion needle (not the tubing) must be disposed of in a sharps bin.
