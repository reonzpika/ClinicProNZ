We all have our own unique priorities, goals and preferences that shape how we live and influence how we would like to be cared for in the future and at the end of our life. \n####  What is involved in advance care planning? (+ APPS) \n####  Thinking about\nThe first step in advance care planning is thinking about what matters to you and what you would like for your future health care. This can include things such as:\n  * your values, beliefs, priorities, worries, what helps you through tough times, and what abilities are so important to you that you can't imagine living without them. \n  * Treatments that you would or would not want and what you want your care to focus upon. \n  * Who you would want to be involved in decision about your health if you were too unwell to be part of the discussion.\n  * Where you would like to spend your last days.\n\n\nHere are some [tools to help you think about advance care planning(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan#thinkingaboutacp \"Open external link\"). \n####    \nTalking about\nOnce you have thought about what's important to you, it's a good idea to talk about them. You should involve the people you want to know about your wishes for care and treatment if you can’t tell them yourself. This could include your whānau and friends, your Enduring Power of Attorney for care and welfare if you have appointed one, your healthcare provider or specialist (particularly if you have been diagnosed with a serious illness) and other members of your healthcare team.\n####    \nPlanning for\nWhen you know what's important to you and what you want others to know in the future, it's a good idea to write it down for your whānau and healthcare team to refer to in the future if you can't tell them yourself. \n[Tools to help you write down your wishes(external link)](https://www.myacp.org.nz/your-plan#writing-your-acplan \"Open external link\") can be found on the advance care planning website. \nRemember, you don’t need to complete every section in the 'My advance care plan and guide booklet', just those that feel relevant to you. \n####    \nSharing\nOnce you have made your plan, make sure you share it with your key whānau members, Enduring Power of Attorney and your healthcare team. It's important your whānau and other loved ones know you have a plan and where the plan is kept. In many parts of the country, you can ask for your plan to be added to your medical record.

People find it useful to decide on a day to review it every year, such as their birthday, Labour day or the time the clocks go back for winter. Every time you make a change, let your healthcare team and anyone who has a copy of your advance care plan know.\n####    \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [falls prevention apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/f/falls-prevention-apps) and [long-term condition apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/l/long-term-condition-apps).\n####  VIDEOS: Personal stories \n#### Video: Arthur Te Anini's story (English subtitles)\n  \nArthur Te Anini has written an advance care plan for his future health and end-of-life care.
