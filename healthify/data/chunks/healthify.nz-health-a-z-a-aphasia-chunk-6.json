Apraxia is a motor speech disorder that may accompany aphasia. Apraxia is caused by damage to the parts of the brain that control muscles needed for speech, eg, your lungs, voice box, lips and tongue. It's not due to muscle weakness but to a lack of communication between your brain and those muscles. You know what you want to say, but your brain has difficulty in telling the speech muscles how to move. It most often happens after a stroke or a head injury. \nApraxia of speech may vary from occasional problems with saying a word to not being able to speak at all. Some people recover quickly, others take a lot longer. You can read the Health Info information on [apraxia of speech(external link)](https://www.healthinfo.org.nz/patientinfo/78424.pdf \"Open external link\") to find out more. \n####  Support \nSupport groups can help both the person with aphasia and their whānau with the changes that come with aphasia and stroke. \n[Support services, resources, advocacy, & information for people with aphasia & their caregivers/whanau(external link)](https://www.healthnavigator.org.nz/umbraco/ \"Open external link\") Aphasia New Zealand Charitable Trust   \n[Support resources, stories, news and updates(external link)](http://www.hopeworks.org.nz/the-brainhub/neurological-disorders-diseases/aphasia \"Open external link\") The National Aphasia Association\n#### Support for PPA\n[Aphasia NZ(external link)](https://www.aphasia.org.nz/aphasianz-contact-details/ \"Open external link\")  \n[Dementia New Zealand(external link)](https://dementia.nz/ \"Open external link\")  \n[Alzheimer’s New Zealand(external link)](https://alzheimers.org.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Stroke | Mate rehu ohotata](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/stroke \"Stroke | Mate rehu ohotata\")  \n[Head injury | Wharanga ūpoko](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/head-injury \"Head injury | Wharanga ūpoko\")\n####  More information \n[About aphasia(external link)](https://www.aphasia.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") Aphasia NZ  \n[Information about stroke(external link)](https://www.stroke.org.nz/understanding-stroke/ \"Open external link\") Stroke Foundation of NZ   \n[Neurological disorders and traumatic brain injury(external link)](http://www.hopeworks.org.nz/the-brainhub/neurological-disorders-diseases/aphasia#TOC-How-is-aphasia-diagnosed- \"Open external link\") The Hopeworks Foundation  \n[What is aphasia?(external link)](https://www.healthinfo.org.nz/patientinfo/78424.pdf \"Open external link\") The Internet Stroke Centre  \n[Different kinds of aphasia(external link)](http://www.aphasia.org/aphasia-definitions/ \"Open external link\") The National Aphasia Association  \n[Apraxia of speech(external link)](https://www.healthinfo.org.nz/patientinfo/78424.pdf \"Open external link\") HealthInfo, NZ\n#### Resources\n[AphasiaNZ(external link)](https://www.aphasia.org.nz/aphasianz-services/aphasia-booklets/ \"Open external link\") produces a 12-page booklet explaining aphasia.
