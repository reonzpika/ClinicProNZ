  "content": "Like a miscarriage, there can be period-like crampy pain. You'll be given medicine to help with the pain, and wheat-packs or hot water bottles can help a lot too. There will also be bleeding that's heavier than a normal period and you may see some lighter-coloured pregnancy tissue pass. Some people can feel nauseous with misoprostol, so you may also be given anti-nausea medicine to help manage this. \nThe main advantages of early medical abortion are:\n  * it's performed early in the pregnancy\n  * it doesn't require an operation\n  * you can complete the process at home or somewhere you are comfortable.\n\n\n#### Late medical abortion\nThe same hormones can be used for an abortion much later in pregnancy, but the doses of hormones needed are higher than those used for an early medical abortion. It also takes much longer, and you need to be admitted to hospital in case you have heavy bleeding or the pregnancy tissue doesn't pass easily. \n####  What is a surgical abortion and how is it done? \n",
