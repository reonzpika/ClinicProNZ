  "content": "When this happens, platelets (blood cells that help with clotting) stick to these cracks to seal them. As long as the artery is not very narrowed, then no harm occurs.\nBut if the narrowing is already severe, then even a small clot forming on the top of a plaque can have a serious effect on the blood's ability to flow through the artery.\nThe formation of a clot is one of the main problems in coronary heart disease. It's the cause of most heart attacks.\n####  Treatment of atherosclerosis \nTreatment depends on the area affected. The narrowing of the artery can be in one area, multiple areas, or affect an artery throughout its length. This is important for your doctor to know as it will affect their decision regarding what treatment is best for you.\nDoctors often talk about 1, 2 or 3 vessel disease; this refers to how many and which of the main branches of the coronary arteries are affected. In general, 1 or 2 vessel disease may be treated with medicines or [angioplasty](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angioplasty), whereas 3 or more vessel disease usually requires [bypass surgery.](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/coronary-artery-bypass-surgery \"Coronary artery bypass surgery\")\n####  Self-care for atherosclerosis (+ APPS) \nWhat we do and eat every day makes a big difference to our risk of atherosclerosis building up in our blood vessels. The key things you can do are the same as for heart health. \n  * Eat heart healthy foods\n  * [Be smoke free](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-topics)\n  * [Keep physically active](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/physical-activity \"Physical activity\")\n  * Have a regular[heart risk assessment](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-risk-assessment \"Heart risk assessment\")[weight,](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/w/weight-loss \"Weight loss\")[blood pressure](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/b/blood-pressure \"Blood pressure\")[cholesterol](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cholesterol-high \"Cholesterol\"). Work with your doctor/nurse to get them down if high. \n  * If you know you have atherosclerosis or any cardiovascular disease, ask your healthcare provider for a[care plan](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/c/care-planning-and-care-plans)\n\n\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Nutrition, exercise and weight management apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/n/nutrition-exercise-and-weight-management-apps), [Quit smoking apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/q/quit-smoking-apps) and [Blood pressure apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/blood-pressure-apps).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Angioplasty](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angioplasty \"Angioplasty\")  \n[Angina](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/angina \"Angina\")  \n[Heart attack | Hē manawa](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-attack \"Heart attack | Hē manawa\")  \n[Stroke | Mate rehu ohotata](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/stroke \"Stroke | Mate rehu ohotata\")  \n[Heart risk assessment ](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/heart-risk-assessment)\n####  More information \n#### Apps\n[Nutrition, exercise and weight management apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/n/nutrition-exercise-and-weight-management-apps)  \n[Quit smoking apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/q/quit-smoking-apps)  \n[Blood pressure apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/b/blood-pressure-apps)\n#### Resources\n[Cholesterol(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-a4-poster \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ, 2019 [English(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-a4-poster \"Open external link\"), [Chinese(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-chinese-a4-poster \"Open external link\"), [Hindi(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-hindi-a4-poster \"Open external link\"), [Korean(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-korean-a4-poster \"Open external link\"), [te reo Māori(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/what-is-cholesterol-maori-a5-brochure \"Open external link\"), [Samoan(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-samoan-a4-poster \"Open external link\"), [Tongan(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/resources/cholesterol-tongan-a4-poster \"Open external link\")  \n[Blood pressure information sheet(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-poster.pdf?mtime=1612490460?1655345860 \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ, 2019 [English(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-poster.pdf?mtime=1612490460?1655345860 \"Open external link\"), [te reo Māori(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-maori-poster.pdf?1655341082 \"Open external link\"), [Tongan(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-tongan.pdf?1655345845 \"Open external link\"), [Chinese (traditional)(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-chinese-a4-poster.pdf?1655345865 \"Open external link\"), [Hindi(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-poster-a4-hindi.pdf?1655345981 \"Open external link\"), [Korean(external link)](https://assets.heartfoundation.org.nz/documents/shop/heart-healthcare/blood-pressure-poster-korean.pdf?1655341377 \"Open external link\")  \n[My heart check(external link)](https://www.heartfoundation.org.nz/your-heart/my-heart-check \"Open external link\") Heart Foundation, NZ\n#### References\n  1.
