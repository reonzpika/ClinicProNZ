These medicines may initially make your symptoms seem worse before you notice an improvement. Other side effects include nausea (feeling sick), headache, sleep problems and sexual problems.\nOther antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants may be used if SSRIs or venlafaxine are unsuitable or haven’t worked well.
