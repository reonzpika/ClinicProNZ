  "content": "They are most commonly given by injection into the inflamed joints.\n  * Biological therapies (biologics) are used to control pain, swelling and stiffness when DMARDS are not effective to control. [Etanercept](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/e/etanercept), [adalimumab](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/adalimumab) and [tocilizumab](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/t/tocilizumab-for-arthritis) are funded for JIA in Aotearoa New Zealand. They suppress the immune system so your child may be more likely to catch infections and should not be given live vaccinations while taking biologics.\n\n\nArthritis NZ has useful information about [your child’s healthcare team and medicines that might be involved(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/children-with-arthritis/talking-to-doctors/ \"Open external link\").\n####   \nExercise\nPhysical activity is essential for good health and wellbeing in children with JIA. Exercise helps reduce the pain of JIA, keeps muscles and bones strong, and improves confidence. You will need to find physical activities and sports that your child enjoys but that don’t cause too much discomfort. Your child’s physiotherapist can advise on suitable activities and exercises. Swimming is great as it allows freedom of movement and it’s fun!\nJIA can cause tiredness so it’s important they get [a good night’s sleep](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sleep-and-children) and maybe some rest during the day. Rest doesn’t mean lying in bed all day as this can lead to further stiffness and loss of mobility. Try activities like listening to music, reading, and artwork instead.\n####   \nHealthy eating\nChildren with JIA can have trouble with their appetite, so it’s important to make sure they are eating enough to maintain a healthy weight and energy levels. A balanced diet is important, including plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, and calcium-rich dairy products like milk, cheese and yoghurt.

During a flare, your child may be in greater pain, their joints may be swollen and stiff, and they may be tired yet have trouble sleeping. In turn, this may affect their mood – leading to an ongoing cycle of pain and distress.\nTogether with your child, you can learn some strategies that will help them through a flare, eg, deep breathing and relaxation techniques. You can also try hot and cold packs, massage, gentle stretching exercises and distraction.\n#### Emotional and social support\nJIA can be a challenge for you and your child as well as siblings and other family members. It may be difficult to explain what is happening during a flare. A team approach to managing your child’s arthritis will help, along with support from family, friends and teachers. Many families find it valuable to connect with others who are living with JIA, through the [Arthritis New Zealand annual Children’s Camp.(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/information__trashed/children-with-arthritis/childrens-camp/ \"Open external link\")\nThe short video below gives an overview of the 2023 teens camp in Wellington.\n#### Video: Abbvie video\n(Arthritis NZ, 2023)\nArthritis NZ has more information about:\n  * [what you can do as a parent or caregiver for children with arthritis(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/children-with-arthritis/what-can-you-do/ \"Open external link\")\n  * [talking to teachers(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/children-with-arthritis/talking-teachers/ \"Open external link\")\n  * [your health team(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/living-with-arthritis/your-health-team \"Open external link\").\n\n\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps).\n####  Teenagers and young adults with arthritis \nIt can be a challenging time for living with JIA as teenagers and young adults deal with the challenges of transitioning from high school in to further education, training or work, as well as transitioning from paediatric to adult rheumatology services. In addition, there are the pressures of balancing the management of JIA, with keeping up a normal life with hobbies, sports, social and school activities.
