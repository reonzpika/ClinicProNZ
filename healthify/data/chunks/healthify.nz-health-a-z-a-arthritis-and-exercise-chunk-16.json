  "content": "Ideally the ‘want’ column will be more emotionally connected. Keep this list handy and refer to it regularly to remind yourself of your WHY. \n\n\n**Examples may be:**  \nI want to exercise to be able to play with my children or mokopuna.  \nI want to exercise so that I don’t end up in a wheelchair when I am older.  \nI want to exercise because it makes me feel good about myself afterwards.\n  * **Be flexible****PLAN B**\n\n\n  * **Set realistic goals**[setting goals](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/g/making-changes-goal-setting).\n\n\n  * **Reward yourself** when you hit a goal or target.\n\n\n  * **Run a movie** _“I’ll feel great when I have done this”_ _“I always feel better when I exercise”._\n\n\n  * **Start short.**\n  * **Move to music.**\n\n\n  * **Lay out your exercise clothes**\n\n\n  * **Make a date.** Just as you would for any appointment or meeting, diarise your exercise and only miss doing it under extreme circumstances.\n\n\n  * **‘Phone a friend’** Speaking to or exchanging texts with someone who supports you is often the little nudge you need when it is tough to get going.\n\n\n  * **Embrace social media.** Join a Facebook page with others that understand your situation. Knowing that others living with arthritis can and have overcome the same issues you have is very powerful in helping you stay connected and motivated.\n\n\n![Father dancing with children at home](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Families/Father-dancing-with-kids-at-home-canva-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg) _Image credit: Canva_\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps), [Physiotherapy and exercise apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/physiotherapy-and-exercise-apps), and [Exercise apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/exercise-apps).\n####  Support \n[Arthritis NZ Mateponapona Aotearoa(external link)](https://www.arthritis.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") offers information and support to all people affected by arthritis.
