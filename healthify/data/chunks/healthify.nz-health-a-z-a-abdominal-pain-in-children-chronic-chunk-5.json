It refers to tummy pain that comes and goes for more than 2 months, that’s bad enough to stop your child from doing their normal activities.\nIt’s often due to constipation or other problems with how your child’s gut works, or it could be related to anxiety or stress in your child’s life.\nIn most cases, there’s no serious underlying disease and your child is well between attacks. The pain usually improves with reassurance from your child’s healthcare provider, and family and school support if needed.  \n  \n\n![Girl lying in bed with sore tummy](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Pain/Girl-lying-in-bed-with-sore-tummy-Depositphotos-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.jpg)\n_Image credit: Depositphotos_\n####  What are the symptoms of chronic tummy pain in children? \nChronic tummy pain can be vague and is usually located around the belly button.
