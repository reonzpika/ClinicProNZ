The most common fatal complications of anorexia are imbalances in electrolytes (your body's essential fluids and salts), which can lead to cardiac arrest and suicide. Kidney, bladder, bowel and brain function can also deteriorate.  \n  \nFor these reasons, getting help early is really important. If you do, you have a good chance of getting better. \n####  VIDEOS: Personal stories \n#### In My Mind: Anorexia\nThree-years ago teenager Arley Gower was diagnosed with anorexia.

Anorexia is an important problem for young people in New Zealand and it is important to screen for it during clinic appointments. HEEADSSS assessment and brief questions are as useful as validated questionnaires. \n  2. Early intervention is important – if in doubt about a young person's weight or eating, either refer them to a specialist service for an assessment without delay or monitor them and their weight and physical observations very closely (weekly not monthly).\n  3. Urgent treatment (usually inpatient) may be required if there are signs of medical instability, particularly bradycardia (<50 beats/minute), hypotension (systolic <80 mmHg) or postural drop (>20 mmHg or heart rate >30 beats/minute between standing and lying). \n  4. Family-based treatment is the treatment of choice for young people with anorexia and is currently offered by specialist ICAMHS and eating disorders services nationally. \n  5. The GP has a vital role in identifying anorexia and in supporting young people and families while they progress through treatment to recovery.
