  "content": "Autism is more common in boys than girls. But this may be partly because not all girls with autism have been diagnosed.\nIt might seem like there are more children with autism now than in the past. This is probably because of better recognition than in the past. It could also be because of changes in autism diagnosis.\nAutism occurs in children and adults – it's usually diagnosed in childhood. Sometimes a diagnosis isn't made until the teenage years or adulthood when social demands exceed a person's abilities.\n####  VIDEOS: Including personal stories \n#### Video: Amazing kids\nIn this animated film (5 minutes 13 seconds), you can listen to children from different backgrounds share their unique experiences of the autism spectrum in their own words. \n####    \nKy's story: Living with autism (Australia)\nAn animated film (4 minutes 06 seconds) which begins with Hugo Weaving speaking about the key characteristics of the autism spectrum as experienced by his own 16-year-old nephew Ky Greenwood.  \n  \n\n(Sentis, Australia, 2016)\n####    \nVideo: Lucy's story\nWatch Lucy's story about her experiences with living with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome.  \n  \n\n(Autism New Zealand, NZ, 2020)  \n**  \n**\n#### Video: Sesame Street – meet Julia\nIn this video (10 minutes 07 seconds), you meet Julia, an old buddy of Elmo's.
