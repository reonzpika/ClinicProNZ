  "content": "A specialist doctor (an immunologist or allergy specialist) gives you a very small amount of an allergen you’re allergic to over a period of 3 to 5 years. Immunotherapy can be given under your tongue or by injection.   \n  \nThe aim of immunotherapy is to increase your body's tolerance to a particular allergen. If it's successful, it can make your symptoms less severe and reduce your need for regular medicines. However, it's only available through private specialists, it's expensive and it doesn't work for everyone. Talk to your healthcare provider or allergy specialist if you're interested in AIT.\n####  What support is available with hay fever? \n[Allergy NZ(external link)](http://www.allergy.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") provides information, education and support for people with allergies (including hay fever), parents of children with allergies, teachers and healthcare providers.
