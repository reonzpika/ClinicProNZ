An elevated MSAFP 2 - 2.5 median value detects 80% open NTD and 90% anencephaly. Uncertain gestational age results in a 5% false positive rate. Amniotic Alpha Feto Protein (AFP) and Acetylcholinesterase are raised with open NTDs. The latter is specific for NTD while AFP is raised in other open defects eg. Gastroschisis.\nUSS: Diagnosis often made at 16-18 week USS. ",
