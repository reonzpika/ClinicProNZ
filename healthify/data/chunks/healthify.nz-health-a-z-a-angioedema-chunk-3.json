It may be itchy, tingling or burning, but often there are no symptoms other than the discomfort of the swelling. Swelling caused by angioedema can develop suddenly or come on gradually over a few hours. It normally lasts a few days.\nThe most common areas of your body affected are your face, lips, tongue, throat and genitals. Sometimes the swelling can be painful, particularly when it occurs over your joints. These swellings can be large and may last for days.\nSwelling in one area usually lasts between 1 to 3 days. Occasionally, swelling of internal organs, eg, your oesophagus, (food pipe or gullet that leads to the stomach), stomach or bowel can trigger chest or stomach pains.\nIf swelling is constant rather than coming and going, other possible causes of swelling should be considered.\n####    \nRash\nOften, the swelling occurs with a raised, itchy rash called [urticaria (hives)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hives).
