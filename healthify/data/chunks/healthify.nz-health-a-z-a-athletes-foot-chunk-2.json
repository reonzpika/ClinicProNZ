If your athlete's foot does not improve, see your local doctor or nurse.\n#### Video: How to prevent athlete's foot\nThis video may take a few moments to load.  \n\n(American Academy of Dermatology, US, 2014)\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Skin infections](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/s/skin-infection-topics)  \n[Tinea skin infections overview](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/t/tinea-skin-infections)\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information on athlete’s foot.
