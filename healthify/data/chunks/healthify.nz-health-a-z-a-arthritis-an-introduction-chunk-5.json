  "content": "[Juvenile idiopathic arthritis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/arthritis-children \"Arthritis in children\") (JIA) is a term used to describe arthritis in children. It has also been called juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Around 1 in 1000 children are affected by juvenile arthritis. It is commonly diagnosed between the ages of 1 and 4 years, but it can occur at any age.\n####  What are the symptoms of arthritis? \nYou may have arthritis if you have:\n  * swelling in one or more joints\n  * early morning stiffness for more than a few minutes\n  * recurring pain or tenderness in one or more joints\n  * reduced movement\n  * obvious redness or warmth in one or more joints\n  * unexplained weight loss, fever or weakness combined with joint pain.\n\n\nIf you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks, see your doctor.\n####  What is the treatment for arthritis? (+ APPS) \nTreatment depends on the type of arthritis and how severe it is. It's important to get a correct diagnosis before beginning any treatment. Generally, for most types of arthritis, the treatment includes:\n  * weight management\n  * exercise\n  * medicine\n  * rest\n  * joint protection\n  * in some cases surgery to correct or prevent deformity, increase mobility and improve quality of life.\n\n\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Arthritis apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/arthritis-apps) and [Exercise apps for older adults](https://healthify.nz/apps/e/exercise-apps-for-older-adults).\n####  What self-care can I do with arthritis? \nA range of self-care practices can help you manage and reduce the effects of arthritis.  \n  \nThese may include:\n  * diet\n  * medicine\n  * physical activity\n  * joint protection\n  * stress management\n  * hot/cold therapy\n  * weight management to prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints\n  * evidence-based complementary therapies.\n\n\n#### Self-care courses and programmes\nResearch has shown that people who exercise regularly, practice relaxation and/or use other self-care techniques have less pain and are more active than people who do not self-manage their condition. Courses are designed to give you the skills needed to take a more active part in your arthritis care, together with a healthcare team.\nVisit our[self-care programmes](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/p/programmes-courses \"Programmes & courses\") section to see if there is a course in your area.\n####  Support \n[Arthritis NZ(external link)(external link)](http://www.arthritis.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") Freephone 0800 663 463\nArthritis NZ employs skilled educators.
