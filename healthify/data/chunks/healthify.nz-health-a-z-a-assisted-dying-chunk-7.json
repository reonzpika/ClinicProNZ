  "content": "This is because you need to be competent to make the decision about being assisted to die right up to the point where you are given the medication. \n####  How would I be assisted to die? \nDoctors and nurse practitioners are the only health professionals able to administer the medication to you or to help you if you want to do this yourself. You would be able to choose the method, date and time.  \n  \nThere are 4 options for how to take the medication. You can take the medication yourself (by swallowing, or intravenously after the doctor or nurse has put a tube into a vein) or you can choose for the medication to be administered by the doctor or nurse (by giving it to you through a tube inserted through your nose into your stomach, or by injection). Some of these options may not be suitable for everyone.  \n  \nBefore you're given the medication, you will be asked if you still want to go ahead. If you're not sure, you can choose to wait and have the medication at another time, within the next 6 months, or cancel the request altogether.  \n  \nIf you choose to go ahead and the medication is taken by you or given to you, the doctor or nurse practitioner must stay nearby until you have died, eg, in the same or in a nearby room or area. You would be able to have any family/whānau or whoever you wanted with you at the time.\n####  Will this service cost me anything? \n",
