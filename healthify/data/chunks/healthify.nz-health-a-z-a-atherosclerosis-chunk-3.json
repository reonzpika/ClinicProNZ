  "content": "This process can be broken down into 3 stages:\n  1. **Fatty streaks** – damage to the inner wall of the artery allows infiltration of fatty substances. At this stage artery damage is minimal and the blood flow isn't seriously affected.\n  2. **Soft plaque**\n  3. **Hard plaque**\n\n\nThis process can affect any organ. Atherosclerosis of the arteries:\n  * going to the brain can lead to a stroke\n  * can cause peripheral arterial disease or clogging of small arteries going to the legs\n  * in the heart can lead to angina or a heart attack.\n\n\n####  What is thrombosis? \nThrombosis is the medical term for a clot, the natural process that stops us bleeding when we injure ourselves. In coronary artery disease a clot forms, not as a result of an outside injury, but as a result of damage to the inner lining of the artery wall, caused by the fatty build-up (plaque) in the wall of the artery.\nNormally the lining of the artery is smooth, but when a plaque builds up, the walls are no longer smooth and sometimes the protruding plaques crack open.
