It's important to know what to do and when you need to see a doctor.\n  * Your abdomen is the part of your body between the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hips. It often gets called your stomach, tummy or puku, but there's a number of other organs in that area too.\n  * Most pain in this part of your body will pass quickly and can be treated at home by yourself or with medication from your pharmacist. This includes when you have: \n    * a burning pain or discomfort after eating (indigestion)\n    * feeling bloated (trapped wind)\n    * constipation\n\n\n![Woman holding abdomen in pain ](https://healthify.nz/assets/Health-A-Z/Pain/Abdomenal-pain-canva-950x690.jpg)\n####  How can you manage your abdominal pain at home? \nIf your abdominal pain is mild, and there are no concerning symptoms, these tips may help:\n  * drink plenty of water\n  * try a heat pack or hot water bottle where it hurts, or have a warm bath\n  * take paracetamol to ease pain\n  * do NOT take aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen) unless advised to as these can make abdominal pain worse\n  * avoid alcohol, tea and coffee\n  * rest your gut by not eating for a few hours, then start again when you feel better on bland foods (such as rice, crackers, bananas or toast)\n  * lie down and rest\n  * if [constipated,](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/constipation-in-adults \"Constipation\") read more about what you can do\n  * ask your pharmacist about medicines to ease wind, spasms or to stop diarrhoea\n  * tell your doctor if your medication causes indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea.  \n  \n\n\n\n![Woman lies down with hot water bottle on her tummy](https://healthify.nz/assets/Legacy/17246/woman-lying-down-with-hot-water-bottle-canva-665x443__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MDBd.png)\nImage credit: Canva\n#### When to get help\n**Contact your healthcare provider or call Healthline (0800 611 116) if:**\n  * your pain is no better after 2 hours of home care\n  * your abdomen is very painful, eg, if you can’t walk or need to walk bent over, or feel you need to hold your tummy all the time\n  * your pain gets worse over time, or becomes sharper or stronger in one place\n  * your abdomen feels bloated or sticks out more than usual\n  * you have [diabetes](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/diabetes \"Diabetes\") and are vomiting\n  * you can’t stop vomiting\n  * you haven’t had a bowel motion (poo) for 3 days\n  * you have lost your appetite\n  * there is blood in your vomit, urine (pee) or bowel motion, or vaginal bleeding that isn’t a period\n  * you have other symptoms as well, such as fever or dizziness, especially if they get worse or new symptoms develop.\n\n\n**Call 111 and ask for an ambulance or go to your nearest hospital if you:**\n  * have sudden, severe stomach or abdominal pain\n  * have pain when you touch your abdomen\n  * are vomiting blood or a ground coffee-like substance\n  * have bloody or black, sticky poo\n  * collapse, or become pale and clammy\n  * are finding it hard to breathe\n  * can’t pee\n  * have any tightness or heaviness in your chest\n  * find the pain spreads up to your chest, neck or shoulder.\n\n\n####  What causes abdominal pain?

\nAs well as asking where the pain is, your doctor will ask you to describe your pain, so notice whether it's sharp, stabbing, cramping or a dull ache. Also, notice whether the pain is there all the time or if it comes and goes in waves.\nYour doctor will also ask if the pain came on suddenly (acute), or whether you have had it for a while ([chronic](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/chronic-pain \"Chronic pain\")). They will also want to know if you have been sick (vomited) or had diarrhoea (watery, runny poo).\nDepending on what they think is causing your abdominal pain, they may want to do further tests.\n####  What is the treatment for abdominal pain? (+ APPS) \nOften abdominal pain will settle with simple self-care tips such as taking paracetamol, rest and treat any constipation. If not settling, review the sections above as more specific treatment will depend on the cause of the abdominal pain. \nIf you know the condition causing your abdominal pain, you can go to the Healthify page for that condition to find out what support is available to you.\nCall _Healthline_ phone 0800 611 116 for free advice from registered nurses 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, if you are unsure about what to do.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [pain management apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/p/pain-management-apps).  \n\n####  How can I prevent abdominal pain? \nYou can keep your gut healthy by eating lots of fruit and vegetables, as well as other foods high in fibre, such as whole grains and legumes.
