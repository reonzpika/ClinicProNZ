It's most common in children under 5 years of age.\n  * Most food allergies are due to a small number of foods such as egg or milk but almost any food can cause a reaction.\n  * Mild to moderate allergic reactions include swelling of the face, lips or eyes, skin hives/welts, mouth tingling, stomach pain or vomiting.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction with noisy breathing, swelling of tongue or throat, wheeze or persistent cough, difficulty talking or hoarse voice, dizziness or collapse. Young children may be pale and floppy.\n  * Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency – call 111 for an ambulance and give adrenaline (epinephrine) if it's available. \n\n\n![Boy with allergy saying no to peanuts being offered](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Food-and-drink/Child-saying-no-to-peanuts-allergy-canva-950x690.jpg)\n!",
