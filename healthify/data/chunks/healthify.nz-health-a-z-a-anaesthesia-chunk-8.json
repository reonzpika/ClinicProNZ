  "content": "Your risk depends on the type of anaesthesia you get, your age, your health, and how you respond to the medicines. Some health problems, such as heart or lung disease, increase your chances of problems from anaesthesia. Being overweight, taking certain medicines, smoking and using recreational drugs can also increase your chance of problems. Your anaesthetist will talk with you about the best type for you and will review risks, benefits and other choices.\nPossible complications include allergic reaction, permanent nerve damage, heart attack, stroke, organ failure, reawakening during a procedure and the risk of dying. Complications are more likely for people who are very young, older or have other health problems. For a fit person under 60 years of age, the chance of dying due to an anaesthetic complication is very low.\n  * It's best to talk about your concerns with the anaesthetist and other members of your healthcare team before your procedure.\n  * Ask about the possible risks and complications that apply to you because of your specific circumstances, eg, your age, other health conditions and the procedure you're having. \n  * You can take a support person with you to be a second pair of eyes and ears during the pre-op assessment.\n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Why should I quit smoking?](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-why-quit \"Why should I quit smoking?\")  \n[Caesarean section](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/caesarean-section)  \n[Pain – general topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pain-general-topics \"Pain topics\")  \n[Pain management topics](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/pain-management-topics)  \n  \n\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about anaesthesia.
