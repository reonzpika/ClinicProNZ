  "content": "If you're getting wheezy more than twice a week, it means your asthma is not well controlled. See your healthcare provider for a check-up.\n  * If you have symptoms of hay fever ([allergic rhinitis](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever)), such as nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes, talk to your healthcare provider about medicine to treat these symptoms, such as[antihistamines](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/antihistamines \"Antihistamines\")\n  * Many people with asthma have other long-term health conditions which can cause symptoms that are similar to asthma, but may not respond to the usual inhaler treatments. Your healthcare provider should review whether this is happening for you. \n  * If your asthma is severe, or hard to treat, you may be referred to a specialist clinic. \n\n\n####  What self-care can I do with asthma? (+ APPS) \nThere are many things you can do to improve how well your asthma is controlled. By working with your healthcare provider to create an[asthma action plan(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/resources/4-stage-asthma-action-plans \"Asthma action plan\"), you can reduce the severity of your asthma symptoms and how often you have them.\n  * Understand your asthma and learn to recognise your symptoms and your triggers.\n  * Take your prescribed medicine, especially your preventer, every day, regardless of whether you have asthma symptoms or not.\n  * Be confident that you're using your inhalers properly – be certain the medicine is delivered to the small breathing tubes or bronchi.\n  * If you smoke, try to[quit](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/smoking-treatments-for-quitting-smoking \"Quit smoking – treatments\"). Try to keep clear of anyone else who smokes and of any other fumes.\n  * If you vape, try to quit.\n  * Ask your healthcare provider about managing allergies if these are a known trigger for you.\n  * Use the[asthma under control test(external link)](http://www.asthmacontrol.co.nz/ \"Open external link\")\n  * Use a peak flow meter to take and record regular readings to check that your asthma is under control.\n  * Stay active – physical activity improves how well your lungs work, and people who are fit usually find they have less asthma and cope better when they do have it. There are many elite athletes with asthma. \n  * Visit your asthma team (your healthcare provider, your practice nurse and your pharmacist) regularly. They will review the medicines you're taking and can teach you how to use your inhaler properly so you get the most benefit. \n  * Keep your[dust-mite allergy](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergy-dust-mites \"Allergy – dust mites\") under control.\n  * Ask for a specialist referral if your asthma is severe or seems difficult to treat in spite of: \n    * you using your inhalers as prescribed, and\n    * other factors that increase asthma-like symptoms being ruled out.\n\n\nRead more about an [asthma action plan.(external link)](https://www.asthmafoundation.org.nz/resources/4-stage-asthma-action-plans \"Asthma action plan\")\n####    \nApps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [asthma apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/a/asthma-apps).\n####    \nSupport\n[Asthma New Zealand(external link)](https://www.asthma.org.nz/pages/our-service \"Open external link\") provides education, training and support to individuals with asthma/COPD and their whānau.\n####  Asthma action plans \nIt can be hard to remember directions or instructions from your healthcare provider.
