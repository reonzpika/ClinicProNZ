  "content": "Or you may have both ADHD and something else, which makes diagnosis more difficult. ADHD symptoms can also be experienced by most people in some situations, usually in a milder way.\nIn Aotearoa New Zealand a good place to start is your own GP or nurse practitioner. They will talk with you about what you’ve noticed, and will probably ask you to complete a screening questionnaire. It's good to get some information about you from whānau or close friends who knew you as a child.\nIf ADHD is a possibility, they will discuss referring you to a mental healthcare provider. This is usually a psychiatrist, a doctor specialising in mental health, who can prescribe medicines. Or it could be a neuropsychologist, who has studied psychology at university and has extra training in brain conditions.\nSome mental healthcare providers in the private system accept self-referrals. This means you can make an appointment without seeing your GP or nurse practitioner first. Some offer online assessments.\n####    \nAssessment\nAssessment might involve:\n  * tests of your thinking (psychological tests)\n  * a physical check-up that might involve testing your heart, blood tests or a brain scan to rule out other problems\n  * questions about your childhood\n  * an interview with a partner, parent or close friend about your behaviour\n  * review of documents such as old school reports.\n\n\nThe symptoms you have and the impact they have on your life are used to decide whether you have ADHD and, if so, which type. There are 3 types of ADHD:\n  * Hyperactive or impulsive type (or both).\n  * Inattentive type (similar to what was known as attention deficit disorder or ADD).\n  * Combination type.\n\n\nRead more about [getting an assessment for ADHD(external link)](https://www.adhd.org.nz/getting-an-assessment-and-diagnosis-for-adhd.html \"Open external link\").\n####  Why are so many more people saying they have ADHD? \nADHD diagnosis has become more common recently. There are lots of possible reasons for this, including better understanding of ADHD in girls and women, and more awareness of ADHD amongst the general public and healthcare providers.   \n  \nSome people incorrectly say that ADHD is ‘fashionable’ or ‘made up’. In fact, the first description by a doctor of a disorder resembling ADHD was in 1775. There’s agreement between healthcare providers and research scientists around the world that ADHD is a valid diagnosis.  \n  \nADHD itself isn’t becoming more common. People who had been living with undiagnosed ADHD are now being diagnosed. This is a good thing because undiagnosed and untreated ADHD can have serious impacts on relationships, employment, mental health and even lifespan.\n####  How can I care for myself with ADHD? (+ APPS) \nThese tips can help you manage your ADHD:\n  * Learn about your brain.\n  * Connect with other people with ADHD (eg, through the \n  * Share your diagnosis with other people who love you, this helps your relationships run more smoothly.\n  * Let off steam by [exercising regularly](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/e/exercise-how-to-get-moving-more-every-day).\n  * Allow more time than you think you need. Use alarms.\n  * If you can afford it, consider an ADHD coach or virtual assistant. \n  * Regularly set aside time to plan what you need to do. One at a time try lists, diaries, visual reminders, post it notes, apps. Use what works for you and let go of what doesn't - without beating yourself up.\n  * Harness your strengths. Think of ways to use interest, novelty, passion, challenge or urgency to get difficult things done.\n  * Setting up daily routines reduces stress. For example, putting your keys in the same place near the door as soon as you come home every time means you won't be hunting for them when you need to leave.\n  * Consider whether your job suits the way your brain works – if not, can you make changes?\n  * Find ways to help you relax, such as listening to music or learning relaxation techniques.\n  * Work on ways to [improve your sleep](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/s/sleep-tips). Putting off going to bed, or not being able to sleep once you get there is common.\n  * Talk to your doctor about driving – it’s much safer on medication than without it.\n  * Practicing [mindfulness](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/mindfulness) or yoga is helpful for many people.\n  * If you have neurodiverse children they'll have extra parenting needs. Consider getting support with this.

It includes:\n  * education to understand how to work with your brain, rather than expecting it to work like other people’s\n  * [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cognitive-behavioural-therapy)\n  * social skills training\n  * addressing any [drug or alcohol addiction](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/addiction)\n  * treating any related conditions, or conditions resulting from unrecognised ADHD\n  * helping you get support from friends or family who can be encouraging rather than critical or controlling\n  * medicines, if you choose to use them.\n\n\n####    \nMedicines\nMedicines can be used to support other changes to your lifestyle and behaviour. They can help you to concentrate better, be less impulsive, feel calmer and learn and practice new skills.\nIn Aotearoa New Zealand, medicines used to treat ADHD in adults include:\n  * [methylphenidate](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/m/methylphenidate)\n  * [dexamfetamine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/d/dexamfetamine)\n  * [lisdexamfetamine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/l/lisdexamfetamine)\n  * [atomoxetine](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/atomoxetine).\n\n\n**Funding of methylphenidate, dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine**\nIn Aotearoa New Zealand methylphenidate, dexamfetamine and lisdexamfetamine are funded under a Special Authority, for people who meet the criteria. A special authority means your specialist will need to make an application to Pharmac (the government medicine funding agency) for approval before the medicine can be funded for you. \n  * From December 2024 Pharmac has removed the special authority renewal requirements for methylphenidate and dexamfetamine.\n  * This means that once special authority approval has been granted, it won't need to be renewed. Your doctor or nurse practitioner can continue to prescribe them. \n  * Previously, people needed input from a specialist every 2 years to renew their special authority. \n  * Read more about the [removal of the renewal criteria for stimulant treatments.(external link)](https://pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/consultations-and-decisions/decision-to-remove-renewal-criteria-for-adhd-treatments \"Open external link\")\n\n\nFind out more about[medicines for ADHD in adults.](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/a/adhd-medicines-adults \"Medications\")\n####    \nDiet\nResearch shows that changes in diet don’t improve ADHD symptoms. If you feel there's a clear connection between your symptoms and a particular food, keep a food diary and take it with you to an appointment with a dietitian.\n####    \nSupport\nSupport is available for people with ADHD in Aotearoa New Zealand through [ADHD New Zealand(external link)](http://www.adhd.org.nz/ \"Open external link\") and [The Triple P Centre(external link)](https://www.triplep-parenting.net.nz/nz-uken/find-help/the-triple-p-centre/ \"Open external link\"). \n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[ADHD in children | Aroreretini](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/adhd-children \"ADHD in children | Aroreretini\")  \n[Anxiety | Mate māharahara](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anxiety \"Anxiety | Mate māharahara\")  \n[Autism](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/autism)  \n[Depression topics | Mate pāpouri](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/depression \"Depression topics | Mate pāpouri\")  \n[Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/o/obsessive-compulsive-disorder \"Obsessive compulsive disorder \\(OCD\\)\")  \n[Mental health topics](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/m/mental-health-topics \"Mental health topics\")\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about ADHD in adults.
