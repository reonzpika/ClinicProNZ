  "content": "Most children with chronic tummy pain don’t have a serious underlying condition. Having a supportive home and school environment makes it easier for your child to cope with the pain.\nRecurrent tummy pain is more likely to be ongoing if your child has had it for a long time (more than 6 months) before they see a healthcare provider. It can also be more likely to continue if parents are very stressed, or families experience lots of stressful life events.\nSerious underlying conditions generally show themselves quickly because they get worse and because they show signs that alert your healthcare provider that there may be a physical cause for the pain.
