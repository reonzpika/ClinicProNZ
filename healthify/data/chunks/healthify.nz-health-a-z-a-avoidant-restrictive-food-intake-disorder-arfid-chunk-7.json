  "content": "* Nutritional deficiencies on blood tests.\n  * Poor bone development.\n\n\n####  What are the complications of ARFID? \nWhen tamariki restrict their food intake, it can lead to complications that can affect their health, wellbeing and daily life. \n  * **Significant weight loss** – some tamariki who restrict their food intake can lose a lot of weight. Or, they may not grow or gain weight as expected. \n  * **Significant nutritional deficiency** – if a child isn’t eating enough or is limited in what they eat, they may not be getting the nutrients they need for their body to function.\n  * **Impact on daily function** – ARFID can have a big effect on a child's daily life. Functioning at school and home can be challenging due to: \n    * difficulties in eating with others\n    * only eating particular foods\n    * taking much longer to eat.\n  * **Mental health** – ARFID can affect your child’s mental health. They may experience low mood and anxiety around food and eating. They can also experience social anxiety and social withdrawal when they feel unable to eat around others. \n\n\n####  What should I do if I notice signs of ARFID in my child? \nSee your healthcare provider as soon as you can if you notice your child is:\n  * eating a small range of foods\n  * eating a small amount of food\n  * regularly showing little to no interest in food \n  * changing in mood or behaviour – especially around food and eating.\n\n\nIf you think your child has ARFID, visit your healthcare provider. Ask for a referral to a paediatrician (child health doctor) or eating disorder specialist service. The earlier you seek help, the closer your child is to recovery.\n####  How is ARFID diagnosed? \nThere is no single test to check for ARFID. Your healthcare provider will talk with you and your child about their eating behaviour, habits and thoughts.\nYour child may also need the following tests: \n  * a full physical examination\n  * a blood test to check for nutritional deficiencies\n  * a urine sample\n  * an electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the heart's activity\n  * an X-ray.\n\n\nYour child won't be diagnosed with ARFID if another eating disorder explains their symptoms better. Your healthcare provider will also make sure that their eating behaviours, weight loss or failure to grow are not due to another medical condition such as [coeliac disease](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/coeliac-disease-in-children).\nYour child’s healthcare provider may refer them to:\n  * an eating disorders service\n  * a paediatrician (child health doctor) \n  * a mental healthcare provider, like a psychologist.\n\n\nThese healthcare providers can confirm whether or not your child has ARFID. They can also recommend the appropriate treatment.\n####  How is ARFID treated? (+ APPS) \nARFID is quite a new diagnosis, and experts are still researching which treatments work best. For all eating disorders, early diagnosis and treatment are likely to lead to better outcomes.\n#### Psychological treatment \nIf your child has ARFID, they might need psychological therapy. This can include whānau and family therapy or one-on-one sessions with your child. \n**Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)**\n[CBT](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/cognitive-behavioural-therapy) is a good treatment for people with ARFID. Treatment may involve gradually exposing your child to foods they fear alongside relaxation training.\n**Responsive feeding therapy (RFT)**\nResponsive feeding therapy aims to:\n  * create pleasant mealtime experiences\n  * create comfortable whānau eating environments\n  * gradually introduce new foods into your child’s diet\n  * help your child learn to cope with their emotions while eating\n  * help your child understand how it feels when they’re hungry or full.\n\n\n#### Medical treatment\nWhen tamariki don’t eat enough food, they can have medical problems. Tamariki with ARFID will need to have regular appointments with their healthcare provider to monitor their physical health.\n**Medicine**\nThere is no medicine that can treat ARFID. Some tamariki with ARFID may also have depression or anxiety – sometimes, medicines may help with these conditions. Your child may need some nutritional supplements if tests show they have low levels of certain vitamins and nutrients. \n**Hospital stay**\nIf a child with ARFID is very unwell, they may need to stay in hospital. Health professionals will monitor them until they are safe and well enough to go home.\n#### Recovery\nWith the right team and support, your child can recover from ARFID. Recovery is possible even if your child has had ARFID for many years. Tamariki with ARFID need a lot of love and support to get better and maintain healthy eating habits. They can sometimes develop ARFID symptoms again. If you notice your child is showing signs of ARFID again, contact your healthcare provider as soon as possible.\n#### Apps reviewed by Healthify\nYou may find it useful to look at some [Mental health and wellbeing apps](https://healthify.nz/apps/m/mental-health-and-wellbeing-apps).\n####  Reach out for support \nHaving a child with ARFID can feel overwhelming.
