  "content": "This is more extreme than just disliking certain foods. Their deep dislike of the sensation of food causes them to avoid eating. \n#### Fear of consequences\nSome tamariki may avoid eating because they are worried about what will happen when they do. This could be a fear of things like vomiting, choking or pain. They might deal with this by avoiding certain foods and only eating foods they think are ‘safe’.\n#### Lack of interest in food\nSome tamariki don’t feel as hungry as others, or they have a ‘low appetite’. These tamariki may see eating as a chore. This can lead to them not eating enough food to stay well. \n![Young girl covering her face and not wanting to eat](https://healthify.nz/assets/Healthy-Living/Food-and-drink/Girl-avoiding-eating-canva-950x690__ResizedImageWzYwMCw0MzZd.png)\n_Image credit: Canva_\n####  Is ARFID an eating disorder? \nYes, ARFID is an eating disorder and a serious mental health condition. But, unlike other eating disorders, tamariki with ARFID don’t restrict their food intake because of concerns about their body weight or shape.\nARFID can look similar to [anorexia nervosa](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/anorexia), as some tamariki with ARFID significantly limit their food intake. Not eating the right quantity or variety of food can lead to medical problems. Other tamariki with ARFID may eat enough to maintain their body weight. But, eating a small range of foods may lead to low levels of important vitamins and nutrients.\n####  What causes ARFID? \nThere isn't just 1 cause for ARFID. ",
