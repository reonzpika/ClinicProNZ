  "content": "The insulin pump will also deliver extra insulin if glucose levels are too high. These are known as corrections.\n\n\n####  What is an automated insulin delivery (AID) system? \nAn automated insulin delivery system is made up of an insulin pump **plus** a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) **plus** an algorithm that links the 2 devices together, enabling them to “talk” to each other.\n  * An AID is like a standard insulin pump with one major difference – they have algorithms that can receive blood glucose readings from a CGM and calculate how much basal insulin to deliver based on your current and predicted glucose values.\n  * When a bolus dose is needed for a meal and/or correction, these systems also have calculators that can suggest a bolus amount.\n  * Bolus delivery is not automatic, manual programming and delivery is needed just like a standard insulin pump.\n\n\n",
