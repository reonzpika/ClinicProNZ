  "content": "Many of the studies have been done in China, where there is concern about publication of fake data.\n\n\n#### Cochrane reviews\nThe most highly regarded organisation for synthesising research in medicine is called Cochrane. Cochrane carries out systematic reviews of health-related research using methods that minimise bias and provide more reliable findings. There are more than 60 Cochrane reviews on acupuncture for a variety of conditions.  \n  \nOn the whole they have not found support for most of the claims of effectiveness by acupuncturists. They either found insufficient evidence or evidence for a small benefit for the use of acupuncture for a limited number of conditions. The evidence does not align with the claims made by many TCM providers. \n#### ACC report\nA 500-page report commissioned by ACC in 2018 concluded that there was some evidence for small short-term relief of some pain conditions, such as some forms of neck pain, some forms of elbow pain, low back pain, some forms of knee pain, and heel pain. The evidence did not support the use of acupuncture for most of the pain conditions they looked at. \n#### Overall\nOverall, acupuncture may have a mild positive effect for some conditions, but it is unlikely to be useful as a sole treatment.
