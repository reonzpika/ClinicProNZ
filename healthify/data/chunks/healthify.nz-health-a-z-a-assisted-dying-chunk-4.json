  "content": "A funded provider cannot ask for a co-payment which means they can't ask you to pay for the service. If you have any concerns or questions around costs, you should check this with your healthcare provider. \n####  Does a decision to use assisted dying affect my life insurance? \nYour life insurance is not affected by your decisionto proceed with assisted dying.\n####  How are my rights in relation to assisted dying being protected? \nIf you choose to receive assisted dying you will be protected by the [Code of Health and Disability Consumers' Rights](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/c/code-of-health-and-disability-consumers-rights \"Code of Health and Disability Consumers' Rights\"). These include the right to be treated fairly and with respect, to care and support that meets your needs, to make choices about your care, to discuss your care in a way that you understand and to receive good quality care.  \n  \nIf you feel your rights have not been upheld, then you can complain. If you can't sort out your complaint by speaking directly with the person concerned, you have two options. You can contact the Nationwide Health and Disability Advocacy Service (0800 555 050) who provide a free and confidential service and will help you resolve the issue. Otherwise you can contact the Health and Disability Commission to [make a complaint](https://healthify.nz/hauora-wellbeing/c/code-of-health-and-disability-consumers-rights).\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Talking about dying](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/palliative-care/talking-about-dying/ \"Talking about dying\")  \n[Palliative care overview](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/p/palliative-care/palliative-care-overview/ \"Palliative care overview\")\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about assisted dying.
