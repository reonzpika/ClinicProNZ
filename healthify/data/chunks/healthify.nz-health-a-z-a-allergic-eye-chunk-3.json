Your doctor will also examine your eyes and check your vision. No tests are usually needed to diagnose allergic conjunctivitis. If you have chronic allergic conjunctivitis, your doctor may refer you for further eye tests to check your vision.\n####  What are the causes of allergic conjunctivitis? \nAllergic conjunctivitis can be caused by several things.\n  * Allergens in the air, such as pollen and moulds, are the most common cause of allergic conjunctivitis and are usually seasonal, eg, during the[hay fever](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever\")\n  * Dust mites, animal dander and feathers usually cause ongoing allergic conjunctivitis when there is exposure to them.\n  * Direct eye contact with allergic triggers, such as cosmetics and preservatives in some eye drops and contact lens solutions, can cause allergic conjunctivitis when used.\n\n\n####  How can I prevent allergic conjunctivitis? (+ APPS) \nThe best thing to do to prevent allergic conjunctivitis is to prevent exposure to allergen.\n  * Don't rub or touch your eyes. If you touch anything you are allergic to and then touch your eyes, this can trigger allergic conjunctivitis.\n  * Wash your hands well before touching your eyes for any reason. \n  * Change to low allergy eye products if your symptoms seem to come on after using eye make-up. Discuss options with your pharmacist. \n  * Use your own flannel, towels, pillowcases and bed linen and change these regularly. \n\n\n####  Related topics on Healthify \n[Eye drops for eye allergies](https://healthify.nz/medicines-a-z/e/eye-drops-for-eye-allergies \"Eye drops for eye allergies\")  \n[Conjunctivitis | Pokenga whatu](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/c/conjunctivitis \"Conjunctivitis | Pokenga whatu\")  \n[Allergies](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/a/allergies \"Allergies\")  \n[Hay fever | Mate hei](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/h/hay-fever \"Hay fever | Mate hei\")  \n[Dry eye](https://healthify.nz/health-a-z/d/dry-eye \"Dry eye\")\n####  More information \nThe following links provide further information about allergic conjunctivitis.
