My suggestion is to, one, put, like, a moisturizer in the body regularly to make sure because, you know, when it's dry, it becomes more sensitive. And then if he gets fresh, every time he exercise, then I think it's probably the sweat that he's reacting to. Even at school, sometimes maybe we got Mhmm. Yeah. Usually, you know, people have it in, like, a have it for a period of time, but they grow like a it gets better over time.
